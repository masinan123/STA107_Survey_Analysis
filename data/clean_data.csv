I really enjoyed the collaborative aspect of the infographic assignment because it allowed us to combine different perspectives and strengths. Working with others made the brainstorming process more dynamic and creative. I especially enjoyed dividing the tasks based on our individual strengths, such as data analysis, design, and content writing. It helped me realize how diverse skills can come together to create something clear and engaging.

What challenges did you encounter, and how did you resolve them?

One challenge we faced was coordinating schedules to meet up and work together on the assignment, especially with different availability among group members. To resolve this, we created a shared online document and set deadlines for each part of the project. We also had regular check-ins through group chats to ensure everyone was on the same page. Another challenge was ensuring that the statistical information was both accurate and presented clearly, which required careful review and open communication among team members.

What advice would you give to future students who will be working on a collaborative assignment in a statistics course?

I would advise future students to start early and establish clear communication from the beginning. It’s essential to divide the workload early on based on each person’s strengths and to keep track of progress to avoid last-minute stress. Don’t hesitate to ask for feedback from others, especially on clarity and accuracy of the statistical content, as collaborative work can provide multiple insights. Finally, be patient and flexible—collaborating can be challenging, but with good organization and teamwork, it can lead to great results.","This course has significantly enhanced my understanding of statistics. Before taking it, I had a basic grasp of statistical concepts, but the structured learning and hands-on assignments have deepened my understanding. I now feel more confident in using statistical methods like hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and interpreting data through various visualizations. The course also helped me see how statistics is not just about numbers, but about understanding and making decisions based on data, which I found particularly valuable.

My overall learning experience has been very positive. The course offered a great balance between theoretical knowledge and practical application, and the assignments helped solidify my learning. The use of tools like R and the focus on real-world examples made the material feel relevant and engaging. The collaborative assignments also helped me develop communication and teamwork skills, which are just as important in statistics as technical ability."

The example infographics provided were helpful, and I think more examples could be given to future students, ideally earlier in the course.

One piece of advice I’d give to future students is to organize a meeting with your group as soon as possible. While online meetings are convenient, having at least one in-person meeting can really help the group bond, complete work, and make decisions more quickly.","I’d like to mention something about the practice midterm test.

1. Before the course: I would rate my ability to communicate statistics as a 2. I had a basic understanding but often found it difficult to clearly explain statistical concepts or interpret data effectively.

2. After the course: I would rate my ability to communicate statistics as a 3. The course helped me improve my understanding and gave me more confidence in discussing statistical ideas, though I still see opportunities to strengthen my communication skills further.

 

 ",1,4,"1. Before the course: I would rate my ability to use R statistical software as a 1. I had little to no experience with R and was unfamiliar with its functions and syntax.

2. After the course: I would rate my ability to use R statistical software as a 4. Through the course, I gained a strong understanding of how to use R for data analysis, visualization, and statistical tasks. I feel confident using R for a variety of applications, although there’s still more to learn to reach full proficiency.

 ",2,"I would rate my understanding of the statistical concepts in each module as a 2 after completing the weekly assignments. While I was able to follow some of the basic ideas, I often found the concepts challenging and had difficulty fully grasping the underlying principles. The assignments helped me engage with the material, but I sometimes struggled to apply the concepts independently or connect them to broader statistical reasoning. This indicates that I need more practice and support to deepen my understanding.",4,"I would rate my understanding of the statistical concepts in each module as a 4 after participating in the weekly tutorials. The tutorials were very helpful in reinforcing the material and clarifying concepts that I found difficult in the assignments. Being able to ask questions and go through examples with guidance significantly improved my grasp of the topics. While I still faced some challenges with more complex ideas, the tutorials gave me a much stronger foundation and boosted my confidence in understanding and applying statistical concepts.

 

 ","I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,"1. How much attention did you pay to TA feedback on your worksheet and on your assignment?

I usually looked at the mark first, and if it was lower than expected, I would then go through the comments. This approach helped me identify where I lost marks and understand the areas I needed to improve on. While I didn’t always review every piece of feedback in detail, I found it especially helpful when the grade didn’t meet my expectations, as it helped me learn from my mistakes.

 

2. To what extent do you agree with the following statement?

“The statistical examples illustrated in this course helped me recognize the usefulness, relevance, and value of learning about and doing statistics.”

I agree with this statement. The examples used throughout the course showed how statistics can be applied in real-life situations, which made the content feel more practical and meaningful. These examples helped me see how statistics are used in various fields and how they support evidence-based decision-making, increasing my appreciation for learning and applying statistical methods.

 

 

 

 ",Agree,"I agree with the statement. The infographic assignment helped improve my ability to communicate statistical information clearly and effectively. It required me to not only understand the data but also to think critically about how to present it in a way that was visually appealing and easy to interpret. This process strengthened my skills in summarizing complex information, selecting relevant statistics, and explaining them in a clear and accessible way for a broader audience. It also reinforced the importance of clarity and simplicity in communicating data-driven messages.

 

 ","One aspect of the assignment that I really enjoyed was the opportunity to collaborate and exchange ideas with my group members. It was helpful to work together to decide how to organize the information and design the infographic in a way that clearly communicated the data. Everyone brought different strengths—some were more focused on analysis, while others contributed creative ideas for layout and visuals—which made the process more dynamic and engaging.

 

However, we did face a few challenges, particularly with coordinating our schedules and making sure everyone was on the same page. There were moments where communication gaps led to confusion about who was responsible for certain parts. We resolved this by setting clear deadlines, using shared documents to track progress, and holding brief check-in meetings to keep each other updated.

 

For future students, my advice is to start early and communicate clearly from the beginning. Divide tasks based on each group member’s strengths and make sure everyone understands their role. Use collaborative tools like Google Docs or Canva to work together in real-time, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you’re stuck. Being proactive and respectful of each other’s time and input goes a long way in making the experience smoother and more rewarding.

 

 ","This course has significantly contributed to my understanding of statistics by building a strong foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical applications. It helped me move beyond just memorizing formulas to actually understanding how and why statistical methods are used. Learning how to interpret data, use statistical software like R, and apply concepts to real-world scenarios made the subject more meaningful and engaging.

 

My overall learning experience was positive. Although there were challenges—such as grasping complex topics or learning to use R for the first time—the combination of lectures, tutorials, assignments, and collaborative projects made the learning process well-rounded and interactive. The structure of the course encouraged active participation and gradual improvement, and by the end, I felt more confident in both my analytical skills and my ability to communicate statistical findings effectively.

I think we can use statistics to solve them.,Agree,I learned how to use visual images to model data which could help other visual learners.,"* I like decorating the poster

* Figuring out which data to include in the info graphic and how to represent said data

* I would recommend starting early and decide among yourself who will do which parts so that there wont be confusions",It has been a good learning experience.
4,4,My ability to communicate statistics rates at level four. The statistical concepts I learned well but I continue developing better ways to explain them in detail. The key statistical methods and results I understand well yet I understand the need to enhance my approach to mastery complex information.,3,3,The level of my proficiency with R statistical software stands at a three. I have mastered basic functions together with data manipulation skills yet I require additional practice with advanced features including modeling techniques and visualization capabilities and error troubleshooting methods. Additional practical experience will help me build better proficiency with R.,4,After finishing all weekly assignments I rate my grasp of statistical concepts at a four level. The main concepts and methods in the material are within my comfort zone for understanding yet I sometimes struggle with advanced material and its diverse applications. The assignments prove helpful in strengthening my understanding by enabling me to tackle most problems effectively.,4,The statistical concepts from each module became understandable at a level four after finishing their weekly assignments. I understand the main concepts and methods of instruction well but I face occasional difficulties with complex topics or their new possible applications. The assignments provide me with concrete understanding while I successfully resolve most difficulties that arise.,I took a quick look at the comments at the end.,Agree,The statement finds strong agreement from me. Real-world applications of statistics became more evident to me through the statistical examples in this course since statistics prove essential in research and decision analysis and data interpretation. Through practical examples I have learned how statistical methods bring value to various real-world fields which makes my learning process more significant and applicable.,Agree,The rating I give to this statement stands at a 4. The creation of the infographic assignment improved my presentation of statistical data but I can make complex statistical concepts even easier to understand while remaining visually pleasing with additional practice. Additional practice will help me develop expert skills to present data both informatively and in a format that is simple to grasp.,Teamwork with other students brought me multiple viewpoints about the material which I found very interesting. Teamwork during the infographic assignment helped me simplify difficult statistical data so it became easy to understand through visualization. The main obstacle I faced involved scheduling group meetings to talk about our concepts because each team member had separate availability. Our diverse schedules made it problematic to discover joint work times. Online group chats together with shared documents helped our team work at different times while tracking our development. The challenge involved double-checking statistical data accuracy together with maintaining proper visual representation of our findings. We solved this by verifying our data twice and conducting work review sessions to verify the statistical methods used in the infographic.,"Throughout this course I acquired a strong understanding of statistics throughout its theoretical base while learning practical uses of statistical concepts. My statistical abilities have improved to the point where I feel confident about data interpretation and analysis together with effective communication of results. The coursework focused on four significant statistical topics including probability, hypothesis testing, regression analysis and data visualization. All these topics are fundamental for working with data across different sectors. The educational experience I have encountered proves to be mostly positive. The combination of lectures and assignments with collaborative work tasks enabled me to practice newly acquired knowledge which strengthened my understanding. The assignments presented difficulties when it came to mastering advanced statistical methods and working with R software yet they developed my practical skills and taught me systematic problem-solving techniques. This course has developed my statistical skills and better prepared me to handle data-based tasks. The valuable learning experience has provided skills that I can use now in school and later in my professional work."
1,3,"Before the course, my ability to communicate statistics was limited because I never taken any courses that relate to statistics before and I struggled to describe statistical findings. After completing the course, I feel much more confident in my ability to explain statistical ideas and results. I’ve learned how to interpret data, explain conclusions in context.",1,3,"At the beginning of the course, I had no experience using R, so everything felt very new and a bit overwhelming.

However, sometimes it's difficult to reach out the group members because not everyone are willing to try their best to contribute to this group work, which make the communication part become harder. For future students, I would advise starting early, keeping open communication, and dividing tasks based on each person’s strengths.",This course greatly improved my understanding of statistics. I not only learned how to perform statistical analyses but also how to interpret and communicate the results effectively.
1,4,"I didn't take any statistical course in high school or elsewhere. Before taking this course I wasn't sure how this course will go for me, but the course and the course team had different plans. This course is amazing for someone who is getting into statistics. It makes sure you get the basic and little over basic understanding for statistics and prepares you for higher level statistics courses. The professor and TA's were also amazing and really helpful with the study material or any doubts you have. ",2,4,Doing the weekly homework assignments really helped with learning about R studio and how to use it efficiently for better understanding of the homework problems with large sample size or even the ones with small sample size. ,4,The homework questions were great and somewhat challenging but really helps you putting the theory into practice. This helped with understanding each module better. ,4,The weekly tutorial worksheets were also great way to recap the lectures and the material covered in the lectures. It's a great way to recall and engage in active learning. The TA's were also great as they would solve the worksheet with the students and explains every step clear and concise. ,"I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Strongly agree,"I agree with the statement, before taking the course I wasn't sure how statistics could be useful but this course taught me the value of statistics. Learning about statistics is very interesting and fun, the problems were solved in the course really showed why it is important to learn about statistics and how it can be useful in higher level fields. ",Agree,"I agree with the statement because the infographic assignment helped me better understand how to present complex statistical data in a simple way and visually appealing way. It improved my ability to interpret data accurately and communicate key insights clearly to a broader audience. Working on design and layout also sharpened my skills in organizing information effectively. Overall, it boosted both my confidence and clarity in discussing statistics. ","The infographic assignment was a great assignment to get to know people in your course/tutorials. I enjoyed making new friends and working together on the infographic. We made a Instagram group chat to share ideas and to discuss who is going to do what for the assignment. I had some issues with connecting with my original group members. They never reached out to me nor I could reach out to them because I couldn't find their school mail or just don't know them in person. I mailed the prof about this and she was really helpful and connected me with new group members. One advice I would like to give to future students is to get to know your peers in your course; that could be by having a small conversation introducing yourself and they introduce themselves to you. By this way, if you can't reach your assigned group members, you can talk to the prof and maybe you can be reassigned with your friends, that would make the assignment more fun to work on. ","The course was amazing with the course material on statistics; covering almost every concept you need to know before taking higher level statistics courses, My overall learning experience was great, the weekly assignments and tutorial worksheets were amazing for active recalling of the course material and also the use of R studio make learning more fun and helpful to understanding homework problems. "

And I strongly agree about statistical example during class,Agree,I think infographic assignment can improve my ability to communicate,I enjoy the aspect about the process we make poster. At that process we find we have too many words in our poster but we try our best to reduce. We finally decide to put some exact rate as our poster background. I really suggest teammates should have a lot of communication in daily life not before the deadline,"In this course I understand the subject of statistics by lecture, tut, and even homework . Overall, I have interested in statistic so I can spend a lot of time on this course"
2,4,"The course taught me a lot about actually analyzing data and categorizing it into distributions such as normal, binomial, etc.",2,3,I didn't really take to R as readily as maybe some other people had. It isn't very appealing to use when better options exist out there.,4,"The assignment gave me hands on experience with the material taught in class, greatly improving my understanding.",5,"The tutorials allowed me to clarify key points and ideas, as well as share answers with other people to know where I went wrong.",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Agree,The examples often covered a wide breadth of topics and allowed me to see just how variably statistics and data science could be applied over many other fields.,Agree,"I did not know much about infographics in the past but this module gave me a lot of experience in working on them and understanding how to better design infographics, as well as what design considerations to make.",I think the fun aspects were adding the design elements and making the infographic actually look cool. The biggest challenges were that it was difficult to find people to actually group up with. I had to move to a new group twice. My biggest advice is to have a group of people you are already acquainted with and familiar. That way it won't be as much of a difficulty.,"The course has allowed me to witness firsthand what exactly 'doing statistics' feels like and has given me plenty of material to comprehend. Being able to actually get an introductory look at this has helped me quite abit. That being said, I do wish this course had a piazza. And that there was actually a grades tab to see my progress, because its only a tad bit inconvenient to individually click on the assignment modules to see my score. All in all though, very good time."
2,3,"A large portion of explaining the statistical code through the course was done through either R Modules or Formula's covered in class. I feel confident in my ability to solve these problems, but I label it a three as I still do have difficulites with some mathematical formulas, how to solve them along with interpreting data from datasets. Occasionally I still do find difficulties in analyzing the data and extrapolating the data necessary to solve a question set. 

 ",1,3,"I still find R difficult to navigate, and in retrospect I don't recall actually inputting code into R myself for large portions, but I found that using R as a site helped introduce me to very baseline ideas about R and what types of problems they aim to solve. ",3,"Some of the concepts I still don't feel the most confident, mostly in relation to which data to quantify for my formulas. I understand a majority of the formula's and the purposes, yet (mostly in the later weeks, 10 & 11 specifically) I found the formula's/theories quite confusing and plan on deeply revising before the exam. 

 ",4,"I've had health issues a large portion of the semester so I was unable to attend a majority of tutorials. However, the tutorials I was able to attend in the earlier portions of the semester I found the insight of the TA and explanations provided helped me thoroughly understand the concepts and their application(s). ",I didn't read the comments.,Agree,I've always been aware of the importance of stats as my family comes from a finance and business background. This course just expanded on prior knowledge and more of the mathematical functions of the course.,Neither agree nor disagree,"I am not a creative person when it comes to digital design and I found it pretty challenging to actually create a respectable infographic. But it is an assignment I have done in prior years, so I am already aware of the importance and role infographics have when it comes to read, interpret, and discuss information clearly and effectively. ","I found the assignment faulty as although I couldn't attend tutorials for my previosly mentioned health issues, I attempted to reach out to students who were assigned in my group. Ultimately I found it frustrating as my condition was no fault of my own, but I understand that this is pretty normal in group projects where face-to-face communication isn't often. ","Overall, besides complications with my health I have found that this course has given me a baseline understanding of statistics that I have never really had to explore in political science. I have used stats frequently in more practical settings, and while a majority of the stats formula's learned throughout the course I haven't used, the introduction to R and how to navigate it is something I plan to use as I pursue my masters at Waterloo next year. 

 "
3,5,"Although I had previously taken a Grade 12 Data Management course in high school and was already familiar with about half of the course topics, I quickly realized that my prior knowledge only scratched the surface. This course provided a much deeper and more comprehensive understanding of statistical concepts, allowing me to engage with a wider range of topics in greater depth. As a result, I feel significantly more confident in my ability to interpret and communicate statistical information effectively.",2,4,"I rated my ability to use R as a 2 before the course and a 4 after completing it. Prior to this course, I had never heard of R, let alone used it. However, throughout the term, we consistently used R for module assignments, which helped me become much more comfortable navigating the software. While we didn’t focus on coding in R, I learned how to interpret outputs such as graphs and statistical summaries, including measures like the mean and median. This exposure significantly improved my practical skills in using R for data analysis.",5,I would rate my understanding as a 5. The weekly modules were very effective in helping me review and reinforce the concepts covered in class. They also helped me remember key statistical terms and apply them with more confidence.,5,"I would rate my understanding as a 5. While the modules focused on using RStudio, the tutorials emphasized manual calculations using the formulas and theorems we learned in class. They were especially helpful because they allowed me to actively apply concepts, and the TA went over the answers at the end, which helped me assess my understanding in real time.",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Agree,"I agree with the statement. Throughout the course, real-life examples were used to demonstrate how statistical concepts can be applied in practical situations, which made the material feel more relevant and meaningful. These examples helped me see the real-world value of statistics and how it can be used to analyze data, support decisions, and better understand everyday phenomena. This made learning statistics more engaging and showed me its importance beyond the classroom.",Agree,"I agree with the statement. The infographic assignment helped me think more critically about how to organize and present statistical information in a clear and effective way. It encouraged me to focus on simplifying complex data, highlighting key messages, and using visuals to support understanding. Through this process, I gained a better understanding of how to interpret data and communicate important findings in a way that is both accurate and easy to follow.","Before this assignment, I hadn’t had the chance to talk to many people in the course, so I really enjoyed getting to know new classmates and working together. Collaborating as a group also made the workload feel more manageable and efficient. We didn’t face many major challenges, but one small issue we encountered was deciding on a color palette for the infographic. To resolve it, we held a quick vote and used the option that received the most support, which worked out well. My advice for future students is to stay open-minded and flexible when working in a group. Good communication and a willingness to compromise can make the process smoother and more enjoyable for everyone.","This course really helped me build a stronger understanding of statistics. I learned not just the basic concepts, but also how to apply them in real situations, which made the material feel more meaningful. Using R and working through assignments step by step helped me see how statistics works in practice. Overall, it was a really positive learning experience. I feel much more confident now in reading and understanding data than I did at the start of the course."

I especially liked the creative part—designing the infographic and turning statistical results into a visual story. It made the data feel more alive and meaningful.

 

One challenge we faced was making sure everyone understood the R code and how it connected to the analysis. Some group members were more familiar with R than others, so we held a short call to walk through the code together and explain it in simple terms. It really helped build a sense of teamwork.","This course has greatly improved my understanding of statistics by connecting theory with real-life data analysis. I learned how to interpret data using visual tools like histograms and boxplots, and how to draw meaningful conclusions from statistical calculations such as confidence intervals and sampling distributions.

 

One of the most valuable aspects of the course was learning how to use R for data analysis. At first it felt intimidating, but the step-by-step activities and collaborative projects helped me build confidence.

 

Overall, my learning experience was both challenging and rewarding. The course made statistics feel more relevant and even creative, especially through projects like the infographic. I now feel more confident applying statistical thinking in other subjects and everyday life."

However, it is not a very good group assignment. This project is difficult to divide into tasks. Everyone has their own different ideas and the workload for each person varies greatly.","I appreciate the possibility of collaborating with other classmates, which is rarely available when studying mathematics and some other science courses. I encountered difficulties in communication. At the beginning, we couldn't hold many meetings because we couldn't find a common time. Therefore, most of the collaboration was done online. I suggest that future students should find a good leader and teammates when undertaking this project, and clearly define the division of labor and goals from the very beginning and keep pushing forward.","I think statistics is not very abstract. It really helped us understand data and models, and we learned a lot of practical experience in life. I think I will be willing to continue to delve deeper into learning statistics."
3,4,"I went into this course with some statistics knowledge from data management in high school, so some of the material was already familiar to me and I already knew how to communicate statistics to a certain degree. So, my answer for the previous question was based a bit on that, but also because I think that there is always something that I can improve on in my ability to communicate statistics. But, I would definitely consider it better and more knowledgeable than before starting this course.",1,4,"I do think that I am able to use the R statistical software after taking the course, maybe not in terms of writing any myself, but I feel like the instruction on how to proceed with the R code every week definitely made it in a way that would improve our ability to use it.",4,"I think that my understanding of the statistical concepts in each module after completing its weekly assignment did improve my understanding since if there was something that I may have not understood or needed more practice from in the lecture, I was able to apply those in the assignment. I didn't put a 5 because I feel that some of them focused on certain aspects of the module more than others.",5,I think that my understanding of statistical concepts in each module after participating in its weekly tutorial did improve since I felt that the tutorial covered a variety of questions from the module / week so we got to practice and apply what we learned as well as being able to ask other students or the TA about any questions we may be stuck on or need clarification on.,I read the comments.,Strongly agree,I think that the examples that were used in lecture (questions for the module) showed that the statistical concepts that we learned can be applied to real life situations. ,Agree,I think it improved my ability in terms of putting thought into how to properly display statistical data / concepts in a way that it isn't overwhelming and accessible to everyone (including those who do not have knowledge in statistics).,"I liked the infographic (even though it made me consider so many aspects).

A challenge was trying to follow all the guidelines of an effective infographic. In a collaboration sense, I think a challenge was that everyone seemed to be waiting for someone else to start something before they can start, so it was resolved by dividing roles and starting it myself.

Advice that I would give to future students who will be working on a collaborative assignment in a statistics course is to do your part.

On the note of collaboration, I think that having a group project closer to the end of the semester when everyone prioritized other assignments definitely affected the work distribution and the tendency to just do it last minute despite being in a group. ",This course has contributed to my understanding of the subject of statistics in terms of newer concepts and ways to interpret data. I would describe my overall learning experience as effective because I felt that the instructors and TAs did a lot in order for us to succeed in this course and I felt like I learned something new that added onto the knowledge of statistics that I entered this course with.

Collaborating with statistics topics was cool, and I also got to meet a lot of people from my lecture and tutorial alike due to this assignment. The assignment itself was super interesting, and I think the biggest key to the assignment collaboration being successful is being open-minded, patient (not becoming demanding instantly, making group mates anxious), and communicating freely. Putting aside any thoughts of shyness and hesitation, with respect, we should approach each other. We should be open about all the suggestions and work our way through the assignment, breaking everything into doable components. Timely communication and breaking down the assignment into doable bits from the moment it is assigned is very important.","This course is the foundation of my understanding of statistics, and it is a strong one this time. I would like to further my understanding of statistics (and especially Benford's Law because it fascinates me) and work with real datasets (via Kaggle or another way) in the future for research. The learning experience was super refreshing. Along with the R assignments, every part of the course was intriguing and interesting in a way that encouraged me to learn more. I think I struggled at first to understand how to correctly study for the course, hence some low marks here and there, but now with all the assignments and supports from the teaching team, I feel like I have learnt statistics in an effective way while discovering equally effective learning strategies."

2,4,"I rated myself a 4 because I feel like my ability to communicate statistical ideas has definitely improved. Before this course, I had a very basic understanding of how to explain stats-related things. But now, through assignments like the infographic and even tutorial discussions, I feel more confident interpreting data and explaining what it means in everyday terms. I'm still not perfect, but I’ve made clear progress.",1,4,"I gave myself a 4 because I started with almost zero experience using R, and now I feel pretty comfortable writing scripts, using functions, and interpreting outputs. The labs and assignments made me actually practice using R instead of just learning the theory. There were still times I needed help or had to Google things, but overall I can now navigate R much better.",4,"I found the weekly assignments really useful for reinforcing the concepts. They helped me apply what I learned in lectures and tutorials in a more practical way. Sometimes the questions were challenging, but that’s what pushed me to understand the concepts better. I usually had a good grasp by the time I finished each assignment.",5,"The tutorials were helpful because they gave me space to ask questions and work through problems with guidance.

Shoutout to Yusuf!!",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Agree,"The course examples helped show how statistics is actually used in real life, whether it's analyzing survey data or understanding trends. That made me realize it’s not just about numbers but about making informed decisions and communicating data effectively. It felt more relevant than I expected going in.",Strongly agree,"I strongly agree because the infographic assignment made me think beyond just running stats—it was about how to present results clearly and meaningfully. It really challenged me to consider what the data is saying and how to communicate it visually in a way that’s easy to understand. It was a creative and practical experience. It was so flexible and fun to work on, and I loved every bit of my assignment. ","I enjoyed collaborating with my group and combining everyone’s strengths to make the infographic. It was fun picking the color scheme and layout, and seeing our final result come together. 

One challenge was making sure everyone was on the same page, especially when we had different ideas or timelines. We resolved this by setting up a group chat and dividing responsibilities clearly.

My advice to future students is to communicate early and often. Don’t wait until the last minute to get started. Use each person’s strength and be open to ideas.","This course gave me a much deeper understanding of statistics. I used to think stats was just about formulas, but now I see it’s about interpreting data, understanding variability, and thinking critically. I appreciated how the course blended R, real-life applications, and visual storytelling. Overall, the course helped me grow not just technically, but in how I think about data and communication.

Canva is a fun tool to use and it was enjoyable to tweak the colours and fonts of my infographic. I was challenged in finding a cooperative group to work with initially, but I resolved this by asking different friends that were in this class and emailing my TA once I'd found a group I trusted. I would advise future students to communicate with their group members to ensure that they accomplish the task on time and incorporating everyone's ideas and work.",This course transformed abstract concepts into tangible tools I can apply to real world examples. This course strengthened my critical thinking as I came up with thoughtful answers to the purpose of the task prompts in the weekly assignments. The overall learning experience was satisfactory; the presence of online lecture videos was very helpful for me to digest the concepts at my own pace.

Although I think I haven't gained total control over the ability to bridge that gap.,Agree,I could see how to make graphic design more visually clear and how certain elements could obstruct that.,"I didn't mind messaging students through external messaging software. It was fun seeing how other students went through with they're thinking process.

Some challenges were that my first group was unresponsive and Quercus was cumbersome to use for communication.

Some recommendations would be to use an external messaging app and allowing each individual to provide feedback on work so everyone can learn and improve.","I would say that it helped me learn the basics of how statistics could be used in the real world. I kind of wished that my lecture was more interactive with something like mathematize as it was a bit difficult to be engaged with the learning. 
I found the assignment videos pretty helpful for guidance through the assignments.

The TA for the tutorials was also very nice and helpful in learning how to apply formulas and understanding what the results meant."

5,5,"The course really boosted my stats communication skills—I can explain stuff like normal models or R outputs pretty clearly now, even to beginners. But I’m not at a 5 yet ‘cause I could still get better at talking to super technical folks without dumbing it down too much.",5,3,"The course got me comfortable with the basics—like running analyses, making plots, and handling data in R. I can whip up a histogram or fit a normal model no problem now. But I’m not at a 4 or 5 yet ‘cause I still stumble with trickier stuff, like debugging weird errors or writing fancy custom functions. It’s not second nature yet, but I’m definitely way better than when I started!",4,"The assignments really helped me get a grip on the module topics—like normal models or hypothesis testing—by making me apply them hands-on. Every week, I felt more solid on the concepts, especially after seeing how they worked in practice. I’m not at a 5 yet ‘cause sometimes the tougher ideas, like interpreting edge cases or super math-heavy bits, still trip me up a little. But overall, those assignments made things click way better than just reading about them!",5,"I’d rate my understanding after tutorials a 5 out of 5. They made everything from the modules crystal clear with examples and chats. Unlike the assignments (where I gave a 4), the tutorials totally locked in those tricky concepts for me—bam, it just clicked!",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Strongly agree,"The examples in the course were spot-on—they showed me how stats pop up in real life, like analyzing data or making decisions. It made the whole thing feel useful and worth learning, not just some abstract math. For instance, seeing how normal models apply to stuff like test scores or surveys totally drove home why stats matter. It’s not just theory; it’s practical, and that kept me hooked!",Agree,"The infographic assignment really leveled up my ability to communicate stats. Having to read data, figure out what it means, and turn it into something clear and visual forced me to think hard about how to get the point across. Like, explaining a trend or a model in a way that’s easy to grasp was tricky but super helpful. It’s not a “strongly agree” for me ‘cause I still feel I could polish my skills a bit more, but it definitely made me better at breaking down and sharing stats!","I enjoy brainstorming and mixing skills—like R and design—to pick a cool data story.

The challenges are clashing ideas and time zones; fixed with deadlines and voting. R crashed once, but we chatted it out.

My advice: be open to others’ opinions and stay flexible.","This course helped me understand how statistics work in real life, not just in theory. I learned how to read datas, use R, and explain results clearly from R. Overall, it was a good learning experience. I struggled a bit at first, but I feel more confident now."
2,4,"​Before taking STA107 , I had a basic understanding of statistical concepts like combinations, permutations, standard deviation, variance, probability, and distribution from high school. However, I lacked the depth and confidence to effectively communicate these ideas. Throughout the course, topics such as random variables, Venn diagrams, discrete probability distributions, expectation and variance, independence, conditional probability, and applications like queues were covered. Engaging with these topics through lectures, tutorials, and assignments significantly enhanced my comprehension. By the end of STA107, I felt much more confident in my ability to articulate statistical concepts clearly and accurately. The course not only deepened my knowledge but also improved my ability to communicate this knowledge effectively, which is essential for further studies and professional applications in fields involving statistics.",4,4,"Before the Course: I would rate my ability as a 1. I had no prior experience with R or any other statistical programming languages. The concept of using software for statistical analysis was entirely new to me.​

After the Course: I would rate my ability as a 3. Throughout STA107, I was introduced to R and gradually built a foundational understanding of its functionalities. The course covered essential topics such as data manipulation, visualization, and basic statistical modeling using R. Assignments and tutorials provided practical experience, allowing me to apply these skills to real-world data sets. While I became comfortable performing basic data analysis tasks in R, I recognize that achieving higher proficiency requires continued practice and exploration beyond the course material.",3,"At the start of the course, many of these statistical concepts were unfamiliar and somewhat intimidating to me. However, the structure of STA107—introducing new topics in lectures and reinforcing them through tutorials and assignments—provided a supportive learning environment. Each assignment challenged me to apply the theories discussed in class to practical problems, which deepened my comprehension and made the material more relatable. As the weeks progressed, I noticed a significant improvement in my ability to grasp and articulate these concepts. While I feel confident in the knowledge I've gained, I also recognize that the field of statistics is vast, and there is always more to learn. This experience has inspired me to continue exploring and building upon the foundation laid in this course.",2,"At the beginning of the course, I found some statistical concepts challenging to grasp. However, the weekly tutorials provided a supportive environment to deepen my understanding. Our Teaching Assistants (TAs) would review key topics, address questions, and guide us through problem-solving exercises. This interactive setting allowed me to clarify misunderstandings and apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. The collaborative nature of the tutorials, where students could discuss and work through problems together, further enhanced my comprehension. While I feel confident in the knowledge I've gained, I recognize that continuous practice and study are essential to achieving complete mastery of the material.","I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,"Throughout the STA107 course, the instructors incorporated real-world examples that demonstrated how statistical methods apply across various fields. For instance, we explored the use of probability models in predicting outcomes and decision-making processes, which highlighted the practical applications of theoretical concepts. These practical illustrations not only clarified theoretical concepts but also highlighted the importance of statistics in making informed decisions and interpreting data effectively. This approach deepened my appreciation for the subject and underscored its significance in diverse disciplines.",Agree,"The infographic assignment greatly improved my ability to communicate statistical information. Before this task, I usually explained data through written reports or presentations. This project required me to simplify complex statistical data into a clear and visually appealing format. I worked on choosing the right colors, layouts, and graphics to make the information easy to understand. This experience helped me see how visual tools can make statistics more accessible and highlighted the importance of clear communication in this field.","​Collaborating on the infographic assignment was both rewarding and challenging. Working with classmates allowed us to combine different ideas, leading to a more comprehensive project. However, we faced difficulties in coordinating communication and dividing tasks equally. To address these issues, we established clear communication channels and assigned roles based on each member's strengths. For future group projects, it's important to set up effective communication early, clearly define roles, and be flexible to accommodate everyone's schedules.","gave me a solid introduction to probability and statistics. The course covered important topics like random variables, probability distributions, and concepts such as expectation and variance. Through lectures, tutorials, and assignments, I learned how to apply these ideas to real-world problems, which helped me understand their practical use. Additionally, the course introduced me to R software for data analysis, enhancing my technical skills. improved my grasp of statistics and prepared me for more advanced studies in the subject."

5,5,I learned a ton from this course. A lot of the credit goes to my TA Andrew. He knows how to teach. He taught me a lot on how to communicate my findings and how to approach different problems in the course.,4,4,"I understand the basic R code, but since most of the R code is already written, there isn't much to learn on how to implement the code to solve our problems. For software, I used teh UofT cloud version since my computer is too slow. ",5,The assignments were practical and hands on. It taught us a theory in stats through a real life porblem which really helped me appreciate my work and learning. It made everything make sence after learning the theory. Oh hey this is what the theory explains!,5,"Again, weekly tutorial was amazing with Andrew. He loves the subject and he loves to teach. It really shows. I learned so much every week from him.

I don't like ""dumbing"" down information for digestibility. I would rather learn what I need to learn and understand the information at that level. For that reason, I didn't get much out of the infogrpahic.",I enjoyed working with my group member. We really hit it off in tutorial and starting participating a lot. We worked together to learn more ab out different topics to include in our infographic. Future advise would be to reach out asap to group memebers. We had 2 members who didn't respond to us and me and Humza ended up thugging it out after talking to Andrew.,"This course has helped me see statistics as more than just formulas and calculations; it’s a way of thinking critically about data and making sense of the world around. I’ve gained a solid understanding of how to summarize, visualize, and interpret data using tools like R.

There could have been an allocated portion of time in class or in tutorials devoted to starting the infographic activity.","Yes, I believe it has given me a beginner understanding of basic concepts."
2,3,"I did not understand to the topics at lectures very well. So, it is hard for me to communicate in statistic still.",1,2,"To be honest, I did not learn to use R in course so I'm still not comfortable using it.",3,It was okay.,3,"I understood the topics better in tutorials than the lecture. So, it was helping me a lot.",I read the comments.,Agree,I understood better with pictures.,Neither agree nor disagree,It was okay. Not very great but still I was able to at least hear other's opinion and their way of understanding of the topic and learn more from them.,"I enjoyed doing the assignment because I met new people and we split the tasks among us so each of us were doing something and at the same time we were asking each other’s opinion. So, we had a great teamwork together.","To be honest, I found the structure of the class to be somewhat more lecture-based than I expected. Personally, I was hoping for a more interactive, problem-solving approach with more emphasis on mathematical derivations and in-class exercises. The lecture style, which mainly involved going through slides, felt a bit less engaging for my learning preferences. That said, the assignments and projects did offer valuable experience, which somehow helped reinforce the concepts discussed in class."

I had a lot of fun making the infographic as well since its been a long time since I used canva for other purposes besides presentations.","1) Some aspects of the assignment I enjoy working on is making the infographic itself since its really fun to make data more interesting.

2) On the other hand, some challenges I faced was trying to connect the data with a purpose because I had a really hard time what this data would be refer to but at the end I got an idea after reading the discussion post (there were a lot of really good song recommendations!).

3) One advice for the students working on a collaborative assignment is to start early, especially if you don't know anyone in your group or the concepts that well. Having a head start allows you time to think as well as being able to time manage well since you and your teammate will most likely plan accordingly.",Yes this course has contributed to my understanding of statistics!

Previously, I viewed statistics as mere calculations confined by number and formula, but now appreciate its application in fostering educated choices across multiple sectors such as health care, business, and politics.

 ",Agree,"Collaborating with one another has further deepened my understanding of the confidence intervals, p-values, and regression results. This was all possible with the help of the infographic assignment, I learned how to visually represent complex statistical messages with infographics which enhanced my understanding. I know now why some graphics work better than others for explaining specific types of information. This will make deviations from the norm much easier when presenting findings.

 ","I immensely appreciated the innovative component of the infographic assignment—particularly how we collaboratively created an interesting presentation for our statistics. It was great to work in my group and appreciate how everyone has a different perspective on data interpretation and visualizations because they have different skill sets—some were great at R, some were design, some were writing. 

One of the challenges we encountered was trying to find a common time in our schedules to work on the project as a group. This was a struggle initially, but we were able to get around it by using a Google Doc and planning brief catch-up meetings on Zoom. That kept everyone aligned and on the same track.

My advice to future students: communicate early and clearly. ","The class transformed statistics from a theoretical concept into something that can be practically applied. I have learned how science, business, and daily life uses statistics as a basis to make informed decisions.  

Overall, the experience was productive—the lectures were well structured, providing just the right amount of theory, illustrative examples, and practical coding assignments in R.

The course improved my understanding of key ideas like variability, significance, confidence intervals, and data interpretation, which makes it easier to explain findings in real-world contexts. I rated myself a 4 out of 5 because I believe there's still room to improve when it comes to communicating more complex statistical models or translating advanced analysis to a lay audience. But overall, I’ve made strong progress and feel capable in this area.",5,5,"After completing the course, I would rate my ability to use R as a 5 because I feel very confident using the software for a wide range of tasks. I can efficiently import and clean data, perform various statistical analyses, create informative visualizations, and write well-structured R scripts.",5,"I would rate my understanding of the statistical concepts in each module as a 5 because the weekly assignments helped reinforce the material through hands-on application. Working through real data problems allowed me to solidify my grasp of key topics such as probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, linear regression, and more. The assignments challenged me to not only apply formulas but also interpret results and think critically about their meaning. By the end of each week, I felt confident in both the theory and practical use of the concepts covered.",5,"I would rate my understanding as a 5 because the weekly tutorials were very effective in deepening my comprehension of the concepts introduced in each module. The interactive nature of the tutorials helped clarify difficult topics, and I appreciated the opportunity to ask questions and work through problems with guidance. These sessions often connected theory to practice, reinforcing what I learned in lectures and assignments. As a result, I felt well-prepared and confident in my understanding of each topic by the end of the week.",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Strongly agree,"I strongly agree with this statement because the statistical examples used in the course were practical and connected well to real-world contexts. Whether it was analyzing trends, making predictions, or interpreting data in everyday situations, the examples showed how statistics is not just abstract math—it’s a powerful tool for making informed decisions. These illustrations helped me see the relevance of statistics in fields like business, health, social sciences, and beyond, and they motivated me to engage more deeply with the material.",Strongly agree,"I agree with the statement because the infographic assignment required me to take complex statistical results and present them in a clear, visually appealing, and easy-to-understand way. It pushed me to think critically about how to interpret data and highlight the most important findings without overwhelming the audience. Through this process, I improved my ability to simplify technical information, use visuals to support key points, and communicate statistics in a way that is accessible to people without a technical background. It was a valuable experience that helped bridge the gap between analysis and communication.","I really enjoyed the collaborative aspect of the infographic assignment, especially the brainstorming and design phases. It was interesting to hear how others interpreted the data and contributed creative ideas for visualizing it. Working in a team also helped me see different perspectives on how to communicate statistics effectively, and it made the process more engaging and dynamic. One challenge we faced was coordinating our schedules and dividing the workload evenly. Everyone had different strengths, so initially it was a bit unclear who should handle which part. We resolved this by having a quick virtual meeting to clarify responsibilities based on each person's skills and availability. We also set internal deadlines so that we could review and edit each other’s work in time.

 

My advice would be to communicate early and clearly with your group. Assign roles based on strengths, but also be open to learning from one another. Use shared documents or platforms to keep track of progress, and don’t wait until the last minute to start working. Most importantly, remember that the goal is not just to finish the assignment, but to learn from each other and build your ability to explain statistics in a meaningful way.","This course has significantly deepened my understanding of statistics by not only teaching the theoretical foundations but also emphasizing practical applications. Through weekly assignments, tutorials, and the infographic project, I learned how to interpret data, perform various statistical tests, and clearly communicate results. The consistent use of real-world examples helped me see how statistics applies across different fields, which made the content more engaging and meaningful.

My overall learning experience was very positive. The course was well-structured, the materials were clear, and the combination of individual and group work helped reinforce my learning. I feel much more confident now in using statistical tools, especially R, and in understanding the role statistics plays in decision-making and research."
3,4,"Throughout the course, I improved my ability to communicate statistical concepts more clearly and effectively. Initially, I had a moderate understanding of how to explain statistical ideas (rating myself a 3), but after completing the course, I feel more confident in interpreting and presenting data, which is why I rated myself a 4.

One of the key factors in my improvement was working on assignments that required me to explain statistical findings in written form. These tasks helped me practice structuring my thoughts logically and using appropriate terminology. Additionally, class discussions and problem-solving exercises strengthened my ability to articulate statistical concepts both verbally and in writing",1,3,"Throughout the course we have been given R statistical assignments almost weekly. At first I had trouble with understanding the code, but after watching the videos I was able to get better at understanding the code. ",4,I had previously taken a statistical course in high school so the concepts were not as different. The weekly modules helped me better understand the statistical concepts. ,4,After participating in the weekly tutorials I better understood the concepts the TA would go over the questions with detail and explain all the concepts thoroughly.,I read the comments.,Agree,I always read the feedback give by the TA's since they allowed me to understand how to communicate my answers better. The statistical examples did help me recognize the usefulness and value of learning about statistics because it made me realize that statistics is everywhere.  ,Agree,"I agree with this statement because the infographic assignment helped improve my ability to communicate statistical information in several ways. First, it required me to read and interpret raw data, ensuring that I fully understood the key statistical trends before presenting them visually. This process reinforced my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex information.

Second, designing the infographic required me to simplify and organize statistical findings in a way that is both clear and engaging for an audience. By choosing appropriate graphs, charts, and visual elements, I learned how to present data in a format that enhances understanding rather than overwhelming the viewer.","I enjoyed collaborating with my peers to analyze data, brainstorm visualization strategies, and create a clear and engaging infographic. The main challenges were coordinating our design choices and ensuring statistical accuracy, which we resolved through regular check-ins and double-checking our calculations. For future students, I recommend maintaining clear communication, dividing tasks strategically, verifying data accuracy, and focusing on making the infographic easy to understand.","This course has significantly improved my understanding of statistics by teaching me how to analyze, interpret, and present data effectively. Through assignments like the infographic project and problem-solving exercises, I gained practical experience applying statistical concepts to real-world scenarios. My overall learning experience has been engaging and rewarding, as the course emphasized both theoretical knowledge and hands-on applications, helping me develop a stronger foundation in statistical reasoning."
1,3,"Having zero experience with taking any statistics/data management course in high school, I had no clue what the statistics were. Now that I've taken the course, I feel like I can communicate to others many of the modules we covered this semester, such as normal/discrete distributions, permutations, random variables etc. I do wish that we dove a bit into the theory behind all these topics. After the reading week we did spend some time in lecture covering some theory and were told that it may help us in future, but since we were not evaluated on it I feel as though the time spent in lecture covering it, could've been time spent working on the applications themselves.",1,5,I found the video demos very useful in helping understand the functions of R.,5,The homework's provided a great opportunity to review the material we went through that week and helped extend my understanding on content material.,5,"Like the homework, the tutorials gave a great opportunity to extend what was taught in lecture.",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Strongly agree,The examples covered in class were very illustrative and context-based that provided a well rounded understanding of what we need to solve.,Strongly agree,The infographic provided an opportunity to understand the applications of statistics that we have been working on all along throughout the semester.,"The biggest aspect I enjoyed was seeing how creative my group members' minds were when it came to making our infographic pop out

 

One challenge we encountered was finding time to work on the assignment, as all of my team members had busy schedules, including myself. To get over this, we agreed to call each other every 3 nights for 15 minutes to update on our progress.

I was lucky enough that all my members cooperated, but one piece of advice I'd give is always make sure that all of your members promise to hold up their end of the bargain, otherwise they are not only putting their mark in jeopardy but yours as well.","Although I wish we spent more time focusing on theory, I do think that understanding the practicality of statistics and the various situations it pops up in showed me how unique a career in statistics may be because there is a wide range of studies I can conduct.

My overall experience was tremendous, and I was delighted to attend lectures, something I never thought I'd hear myself say."
1,3,I don't believe I'm too proficient in communicating statistics as I'm not 100% confident in my ability to do so. I don't feel l received a lot of constructive feedback.,1,4,"I feel pretty comfortable using R in this course, I feel the use of R was very much guided which helped a lot in gaining confidence in the program.",4,"The weekly assignments contextualized the statistical concepts taught in each module. This helped my understanding, however, I felt lost in computations without doing extra practice.",4,"My TA explained concepts very well, which helped me understand them.","I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Neither agree nor disagree,"I feel that sometimes the statistical examples helped, but I often got lost in them (I wasn't always able to follow them).",Agree,The infographic assignment helped me condense and simplify data presented to me which helped my understanding.,"I enjoyed being able to have creative control over a project which is the only time I've been able to practice this in university so far. I struggled to get in touch with my group mates, and there was a lot of confusion on that end. I would tell future students to have fun with the project.","I would describe my learning experience as well, and I would say this course (especially the R component) piqued my interest in statistics."
1,3,"I did not understand statistics at all before this course. After taking this course, I studied the subject for assignments and the exam so I understand it better than before. It honestly is interesting because I enjoy logic",1,4,I did not know R existed before taking this course. I am much more comfortable with it now.,2,The weekly assignment was a R assignment based on the module. It was sometimes hard to understand the purpose of the task.,3,The TAs are great teachers so I learned a lot from them.,I took a quick look at the comments at the end.,Agree,If you want to go into computer science or a research heavy field then statistics is required to make sense of the data you collect. ,Agree,It helped me to learn how to make statistical information accessible to the general population.,"I enjoyed meeting and talking to other students
We did not really encounter much challenges
Not much it was all smooth",I understand statistics more than I used to. The TAs are super helpful. I learned a lot of statistics from my TAs
2,2,"I feel like the way the course was taught focused too much on the proofs, less about on how to actually apply various formulas and the understanding of graphs. First, we had proofs that were already hard to understand, and even attempting to try and understand them would take a lot more time than needed, so, when the actual important bits of the lecture appeared in the slide shows, it was easy to miss behind all of the proofs. Also, I would suggest less R coding, it was very hard to understand too, especially for those who don't plan to code. ",3,3,"In terms of doing the R markdown assignments, I would say fair, easy enough to understand what is going on. However, if we are talking about the R coding in the lectures, it made learning new concepts extremely hard to understand. I feel like the course should of focused on the math side of things instead of the scrambled proof, coding, math mix. Especially since the exams and tests focus primarily on the math. I also think lectures should have done less R coding and proofs. A suggestion is possibly making the R coding lectures and proofs part of the asynchronous portion of learning, where we can choose to do it on our own. For example, you can make an extra video covering the codes/proof in the weekly assignments we did. ",1,"To be honest, they did not help. Instead, it was more the understanding the UI of R studio that, I feel, the assignment helped with instead. A suggestion would be to focus more on what the exam and test might cover. Assignments focused too much on theory, like central limit theorem or law of large numbers to name a few. If they instead focused on the applications of math, I feel they would reinforce concepts a lot better. Maybe future assignments could be a mixture of both, that would definitely help. ",4,"Tutorials, for the most part, were helpful. This is because they actually focused on the math side of statistics more. For 1 hour, there is only so much you can do, so I think it was definitely good,. Not to be harsh, but I would say better than the lectures sometimes. ",I took a quick look at the comments at the end.,Neither agree nor disagree,"Neutral on this, as I explained before, lectures were hard to understand. At the same time, if you did understand some of the examples in class, it did teach some value of learning and usefulness in doing statistics.",Disagree,"To put it short, lectures confused me, even the lecture videos were still hard to understand due to the same lecture slides being used. ","Assignments were fair and easy, small refreshers for the theories we learned in the modules. 

 

Lectures were hard, did not solve them, would essentially skip them and the, maybe, if I had time, would use ChatGPT and the lecture videos to help me understand that week's module.","I would say stressful, because concepts were pretty abstract, although, I do really like the math portion of this course, even though it was often ambiguous in lectures. Proofs and R markdown coding confused me too much. Simplifying the lectures for only the important things we need to know for the tests and exam would help greatly, assignments should have been the only part where we do R coding and proofs. "
3,4,"Many of the concepts we covered in the course was covered in high school, so I already was familiar with communicating the information. The second half of the course was new content.",1,3,"Going into the course, I had no experience with using R, after this course I am able to understand the programming language, and write some code, but there is still lots of learning that I would need to do.",4,each week focused on one concept while tying it back to previous weeks. I was able to see how the concept was used and how it is tied to other concepts we have learned.,5,"I think that having a worksheet for each week that is done in ""groups"" (more in the sense of being able to ask for help and feedback by a TA and peers) enforces the learning that you have done as you apply it from theory. Additionally knowing that the answers are and getting that feedback is important.",I read the comments.,Agree,I think there have been many examples and scenarios explained in class and tutorials on where the concepts we learn are applied in real life.,Agree,"I think that the infographic assignment gave us the minimum amount of data, and gave us the freedom to analyze it how we wished, which meant using the concepts we learnt. Additionally we were able to communicate how we saw the data to our groups to come to a conclusion on what needs to be on the infographic.","I enjoyed laying out the infographic and designing in. I also enjoyed figuring out how to analyze the data so that it would fit with the idea we are trying to bring forth. The man challenge was trying to figure out how to remove a lot of the statistical jargon used and bring only the necessary information. The best piece of advice I would give is just to start early, it means that you have extra time to adjust if something is wrong and have time to move things around to your liking.","I would say that I have enforced a lot of previous knowledge from high school, as much of it explained why we use those concepts, while also learning a lot of new concepts that are foundational pieces of knowledge. I would say I had an enjoyable time learning statistics, as it felt like I was learning without it being a hassle."
3,3,"I found the teaching in this course to be challenging at times due to a lack of consistency and organization. It was often difficult to follow the material, especially when one of the professors used slides that were completely different from those provided by the course coordinator. I’ve primarily relied on tutorials and external resources like YouTube to grasp the concepts. Unfortunately, I also found the textbook to be of limited help in clarifying the material.",2,2,"The only practical skills I feel I gained in RStudio were limited to creating new projects, adding comments, and knitting Markdown files. Unfortunately, we didn’t get much hands-on experience with actual coding. If someone asked me to complete a task in RStudio from scratch, I wouldn’t feel confident doing so. While the lectures involved the professor walking us through code for 30 minutes to an hour, this approach felt more like passive observation than active learning. It wasn’t particularly engaging or effective. I believe it would have been far more beneficial to focus on writing and experimenting with code ourselves, rather than simply being shown what it does.",2,"I found that the assignments didn’t really help me learn the core content of the course. They mainly focused on graph interpretation, which isn’t an area I personally struggle with. My main challenge lies in understanding and applying the mathematical side of statistical calculations. Interpreting graphs is a skill that, in comparison, can often be picked up fairly quickly. If the assignments had placed more emphasis on practicing the mathematical aspects—which many students tend to find more difficult—I believe they would have been far more effective and valuable for learning.",5,We went over difficult problems and I was able to understand everything to a much better degree. My TA was also really good at explaining things so I thought that was really useful too. The best thing about this course was the tutorials to be honest. ,"I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,Examples help solidify concepts especially since those examples can appear on the midterm/final so it helped when we went over it in class. ,Strongly disagree,We already do that in the assignments and I thought there was no real significance in making another assignment about it. ,I liked the collaboration aspect because it helped solidify how we understand graphs and weakness that my teammates and I may have had when it came to analyzing data. The only challenge really was figuring out how to use the data in an infographic and communicate it effectively and we solved that by meeting up with each other and discussing it together. My advice to future students is to meet up with your groupmates because it helps to discuss things together as a group. ,"Overall, I would rate my experience in this course a 5/10. I found that the lectures often lacked clarity, which made it difficult to fully grasp the material. While we were introduced to RStudio, the way it was taught didn’t contribute much to my learning—aside from analyzing graphs, which is something that could be learned without using RStudio. On the other hand, the tutorials were a highlight of the course; they were informative and genuinely helped me understand the content. Unfortunately, the assignments didn’t really support my learning either. I think the course would have been much more effective if we had been given more opportunities to actively practice coding in RStudio, rather than just watching it being demonstrated."
4,4,I knew a fair chunk of the material before starting the course but as I feel my average sitting at about an 80% I decided to give myself an honest assesment of 4/5. ,3,3,I'm really not that good at coding. I know how to use R and I can sort all the data well and find what I need to find when the code is done for me but the actual coding myself part I'm not great at. ,4,I believe I understood most of the assignments but in all honesty they were not the most helpful for understanding the material. ,5,Tutorials helped a lot actually. I found them very useful when it came to understanding the material.,I read the comments.,Strongly agree,"Well, I want to major in stats so I am a little biased, but I still really enjoy statistics after this course and want to continue pursuing it",Neither agree nor disagree,I don't think it improved it was more just practice of everything we have done throughout the year. It was essentially a HW assignment but much bigger and with a lot more aspects but the fundamental learnings behind it were things I had already learned from the course. ,"Yea it was all good when I moved groups. Once I moved, we were able to divide the work evenly and everyone chipped in. Biggest challenge was doing everything by certain times because some people weren't free on certain days and everyone had to manage their schedules. We managed to work it out in the end and some people had to make some sacrifices in order to work on the project at the same time. I would say start as early as possible and get to know your group members early on to really get a jump on things. That way if they do not respond like my original group didn't, then you have time to move groups. ",I believe it has helped me a lot. It felt a little bit like a refresher course. There was a lot I had learned in the past but could not remember so I would say the course did a great job of refresher my memory and also teaching me some new concepts that I had not seen before. 
3,3,"Through the material learns and class lectures, and as a student who has been active and coming to lectures. I find myself in a position where I can actively relate real-world applications to statistics subconsciously and be able to communicate also on an exceptional level as well. Although I do have some trouble figuring out concepts but on an immediate level i can communication to an extent",3,3,"The video demonstrations were very helpful, in my personal experience i feel as if i did more coding and watched tutorial i would have a better understanding of the codnig aspect, but overall i really enjoy using R and seeing the visualization of the data. ",4,"I think the reflection piece has helped me understand the behind the scenes of the coding more, as well as the graphs helped me understand the concepts too. I think both of those major components in the assingment made the outcome more effective in terms of learning.",3,The questions we did in tutorial were helpful for a deeper understanding- I feel like if there was a 10 min session in the beginning just for a more deep analysis of key notes and key ideas we will run through would help me put it better in practice when doing the questions. I also would have liked if we just worked independently along the TA guiding us through,I read the comments.,Agree,"The examples helped me a lot to put the concepts in more practice so i can see visually (as a visual learner) how it works. I think those were the most helpful for me seeing examples rather than just ""Doing"" the questions vaguely. ",Neither agree nor disagree,"instructions were not very clear as to what we are even doing with the data it felt very on our own based. its not something i feel like i should go up to the TA or Office hours to find that out, but rather the instructions should be clear themselves on the website to find out, i struggled with this a lot, other than that it was okay.",i enjoyed making infographic i felt creative. challenges was talking to other students to find out how to do some things because it was very vague instructions in my opinon. advice would be to make many friends and talk to professor about things you are confused about,"overall learning was good, lectures would go off track here and there, but it was nice and enjoyable learning especially when professors are passionate about what they do. i think TAs and profs made the course more helpful and successful as well as being an active student in the class in terms of coming in class on time, things like that."
2,3,Before going into the course I had no idea about statistics only a bit of the intro probability. I think there are still some topics that I am weak in such as looking at R code and some of the sampling distributions. ,1,2,I still don't really understand R code that well only the outputs.,3,I thought I understood the modules to a good amount until I did the term test which proved otherwise.,3,Same as before but the tutorials did help me better understand each concept a bit more.,I read the comments.,Neither agree nor disagree,"For me, there weren't enough real-world examples that didn't help me much to recognize the value. I think the fact the course also focused on a bit of equation proofs and R code analysis that pulled me away from the recognition. ",Neither agree nor disagree,The infographic assignment felt a little rushed so there was not a lot of time for in-depth interpretation or discussion of the findings. Although the due date was pushed to a later date it was announced near the due date so my group had already finished the assignment by then and nothing further was changed.,"Meeting new people, I even made a new friend.

The group times issues, but we were able to split that into two teams of two where each team either did the infographic or document.

I'm not sure.",It gave me more of an understanding of how some topics just as confidence can be found through statistics. I think overall the course was fun and not as stressful as the other courses. 
4,3,"The activities in the course helped me express statistics in a new light.

This course was not revolved around mindless computation, but instead conceptual understanding of the topics. I mainly noticed this within our tutorials/homework activities, where we would be given a real-life scenario and apply it in our way to statistics. 

 

Personally, these homework assignments were the most engaging parts of the course for me. The only part that I wouldn't enjoy is the learning curve for R, especially considering I was expecting the course to be very introductory. However, I do appreciate the professor's attempt to continue making the R activities as simple as possible, such that we don't have to learn it to such a deep extent.

 ",2,2,"I did not personally enjoying using the statistic software. In the future, I feel like I wouldn't particularly have much experience based off this course, however it's worth nothing that it was not absolutely nothing.",4,"As I stated before, the weekly assignments were an integral part of my learning throughout this course.",3,"I enjoyed the tutorial activites when they related to the homework assignments, however sometimes I feel like the alotted time and pressure of getting everything right in a 'quiz' environment was not in my best interests for learning purposes.",I didn't read the comments.,Agree,"The illustrations were a great part of the course. They helped me visualize, and moreover, conceptualize the concepts give en within the course. The only issue I had with these sometimes is reading long R documents.",Disagree,"I believe working in a group project environment was not appropriate for this level of course. It was difficult to communicate, and I feel like a smaller assignment as a solo assignment could possibly work better.","Enjoyed

The pre-assignment information given to us.

 

Challenges

Communication was a huge challenge throughout this. It's very difficult to work in a group project environment with the difficulty in communicating. 

 

Advice

Try to reach your group members early.","The learning experience was great, the only true advice I can give is to keep the R activities more introductory, or remove them and let students only deal with the interface / final product."

However since the assignment was not that indepth the concepts cover were fairly simple and trivial to deconstruct already.,"I enjoyed engaging with others as this group assignment forced collaboration which at this point in university seems pretty rare. The biggest hurdle was time management, however, as with more group members the harder it is to set meetings and distribute work equally. I would advise future students to start and meet with your group members early to avoid this time management effort and encourage collaboration and a group effort approach for the work process of this assignment. This approach will optimize the social factor in this group assignment while minimizing the challenges a group assignment cause.",This course has been my first introduction to statistics and modeling data helping me visual distributions and calculate the probability of real-world events that will affect the our world. My overall learning experience was good with lectures introducing the topic and lecture videos ingraining the topic further into my knowledge.

It motivated me to engage more with the material and appreciate the value of learning statistics.",Agree,"I agree because the infographic assignment gave me a chance to apply what I learned in a more visual and creative way. It helped me practice breaking down complex statistical information into something clear and accessible. While I still have room to grow, I definitely feel more confident in interpreting data and explaining it to others now.","Working collaboratively on the infographic assignment was a rewarding experience, as it allowed us to combine creativity and statistical analysis while learning from each other’s strengths. Challenges like scheduling conflicts and design disagreements were resolved through clear communication, compromise, and tools like shared calendars and Slack. My advice to future students is to establish roles early, communicate openly, and use collaborative platforms to stay organized—flexibility and teamwork are key to success!","This course has significantly deepened my understanding of statistics by breaking down complex concepts into manageable and practical components. The use of real-life examples and hands-on assignments, like the infographic task, helped me see how statistics can be applied outside the classroom. I now feel more comfortable interpreting data, identifying patterns, and making informed conclusions. Overall, my learning experience was engaging and insightful. While there were some challenging moments, the tutorials and assignments helped reinforce my understanding and built my confidence in using statistical tools."
3,4,"Because I had in touch with statistics in high school, I have a general understanding about statistics and probabilities. With the study in STA107, I have a more detailed and specific understanding. Although it is still not perfect, I hope I can acquire more knowledge in the future.",1,4,"I have never used R software before taking STA107. However, with the help of the assignments, I am more familiar with the software and have a general understanding of the graphs and data. I hope I can study how to program in R in the future.",4,"I chose scale 4 because the assignments are usually designed to give students a better view of the course content in each module. I like the assignments because they are straightforward and direct, we can know what the instructors are trying to test us on through the assignments.",5,"I chose scale 5 because my TA is very responsible. Not only she explains the worksheets very well, but also she gives us some little lesson about the course content. Her explanation helps me to get a better understanding about each module.",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Agree,I agree with the statement because the examples used either in class or in assignments are vivid and easy to understand. The examples have helped me to relate to my real life scenarios and recognize the value of the statistics.,Neither agree nor disagree,"I think the infographic assignment somewhat improve my communication ability about the statistical information. However, I am still a little bit confused sometimes and get afraid of whether I am saying it clearly.","I enjoyed using R to discover the results of the distribution of the songs duration and lyrics. I encountered some challenges as well. For example, my teammates are procrastinate sometimes, so it would take us a long time to communicate back and forth online. So we just scheduled a meeting in person and assigned the work fairly. I would like to say to the future students that it may seem like a big project to do, but as long as you communicate with the teammates effectively, you will be fine.","Overall, I enjoyed my study in STA107, it inspired me to keep studying statistics. I hope I could get into STA major and use the content studied in class and see if I can apply to my real life and make some differences."
2,4,"Initially, I came in with the knowledge from my Grade 12 data management class, so I was interested and was knowledgeable about some faint concepts, but not too much. As I attended lectures, watched module videos and attended tutorials I found the concepts clicking naturally in my brain and was able to communicate it very well- this was also definlty due to the "" purpose of the task"" questions that had me sit down and think about the story behind each module we were learning about. ",1,3,"I knew of the R language but never worked with. Coming out of the course, I am very familiar with it and got to see how it works! But other than changing colors, I am not sure I know how to manipulate the code itself or write my own methods in R. ",3,"For me personally, the assignments didn't really reinforce the taught concepts but more so served as an example, if that makes sense. I think with my learning style, I learn more from applying than seeing examples, which is why tutorials were great for me (I'll get into that in the next question). But I think in a general sense, the weekly assignments were great because for some people, examples are what reinforce concepts for their brains.",5,"The way the course was taught, after going into lectures, even if I didn't do the practice problems for that week, I knew how to approach tutorial questions and apply the taught concepts which allowed me to have a good understanding of each module which I appreciated. Doing those practice problems collectively with TA support but also an independent approach was ideal for my learning style and it reinforced the concepts very well for me. ",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Strongly agree,"From the first lecture, Asal described statistics to be an art, a numerical way to explain the nature of things. I appreciated this notion right away and applied it to my learning across the semester, Adapting that perception in addition to having all those real life examples made me see how prevalent statistics is in our day to day and how much it should be appreciated. I also liked how it applied to different fields, lately statistics has only been mentioned in the field of AI or machine learning but evidently, its a foundational tool across many disciplines which we saw with weekly assignments related to bio, games of chance etc. ",Strongly agree,"As I said, the notion that stats is like art was an important lesson to understand, and I like that we got our own opportunity to showcase that. It helps people play in or find their strengths. To be specific, I didn't even know much about making infographics, but with this assignment I found out how much I enjoyed it how fun it is to visually explain my findings. "," I liked the fact we had creative freedom, at first, the fact that it was up to us to decide what to put on the infographic was a bit challenging because I was unsure of what we should include, and I was worried I would miss something. But then I realized we just have to communicate our findings in whichever way we see fit, which is actually fun! Tell the story in our own way. As for the specific collaborative part, I think it was great because at any moment someone was confused, we had each other to fall back on and help each other out. For example, I found a really good statistic to include in our infographic but I was stuck on how to make it look visually appealing, so I was able to simply ask my group member"" hey could you look at this and help me make it look prettier"" and she came to the rescue! As for advice, this is sort of cliche but communication is key because there's a lot to work with but communicating thoughts and concerns will make the process 10x easier.","I really enjoyed this course! I appreciated how much the faculty cared about student learning, I would look forward to my classes because I felt engaged and never overwhelmed. I feel secure in the foundation I have which I am excited to carry onto upper year stats courses. "
2,4,"Prior to the course, I wasn't aware of the level of depth that can be derived from data. Aside from basic stuff like mean, median, mode, range, etc, I had no clue about all the different types of graphs and calculations that could provide a very deep insight - such as standard deviation, variance, box plots, etc. ",2,4,"Prior to this course, I had no experience in R programming, and just some experience in python and C# (which, to be frank, allowed me to understand the general idea of what programming languages do and how they work, but aside from that, didn't really carry into R that well)
After the course, due to the weekly Tuts and homework, I was able to get a good grasp on reading R outputs, as well as a somewhat decent grasp on writing R code. ",4,The weekly assignments were a good way for me to keep my skills sharp and actually apply what I learned. I found that having to explain things in my own words allowed for me to have an opportunity to critically think about what I had learned that week. ,4,"The Tuts almost felt like mini tests, except they were more open book. It allowed for me to apply the weekly content in a test-like setting, and the fact that the TA's were available for help all the time made it easy to seek clarification and ask questions. ","I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,"It allowed me to understand that there is much more depth to data and data sets than just mean, median mode, etc. One such example is the distribution type. Looking into how exactly distributions are skewed, for example, gives you a type of insight that you wouldn't have otherwise gotten from just looking at the median or mode of a dataset. These are things I learned only thorough this course and didn't know previously. ",Disagree,"I don't necessarily agree. I think that a lot of the stress of the infographic boiled down to art and creativity, which are good things, but not necessarily related to understanding, interpreting and discussing statistics. Especially since infographics are not meant to convey statistics with such a deep understanding of them as we do in stats107. rather, they are meant to be comprehendible to the average person. ","Talking with new people was definitely enjoyable. One challenge encountered was actually getting on the same page with the rest of the group, and this is natural as we don't know each other. It will obviously take longer for everyone to get in the group chat, discuss roles, etc. 

For future students, I would recommend splitting up the work as soon as the assignment starts, and having the leader check in every few days just to ensure everyone is indeed progressing and no one is lagging behind. ","I think this course was overall beneficial. It has definitely allowed for  me to get a grasp on statistics that I didn't have before. As someone who is into computer science and aspires to get into the tech field, I do believe that I, as well as everyone else in the field and other adjacent fields should have, at the very least, a basic grasp of statistics that this course provides. "

After everything was completed, it gave us a sense of pride to be able to create an infographic ourselves,

The challenges I encountered was were rather trivial as working as a team, we could all solve each other’s shortcomings or errors as it showed up. However I believe the assignment would be challenging if we had to solve it individually 

I would advise them to pick a team around people they know, so that they can collaborate far more effectively and get the assignment done without any hiccups.",I believe that this course significantly contributed in both learning statistics and more importantly furthering interest in pursuing it in the future. Overall the coursework wasn’t too heavy which allowed me to focus more or learning instead of memorising concepts and regurgitating them on exams. The lectures were also quite interesting and fun to attend

It is very interesting and motivating to learn. ",Strongly agree,"The infographic allowed me to understand the importance of delivering statistical data using simple language, and in this way communicate the results of an experiment to the public. ","I enjoyed the discussions with my teammates as we are working toward a common goal. The challenges we encounter were mainly in the interpretation of the data and graphs, but we have then resolved by checking out the lecture slides and reaching out to TAs. The advice I will give to future students is to be active and present, since the assignment won’t be completed without team efforts; also to be communicative, ask all your questions and try your best at all times. ","My learning experience has been great, there is lots of support from professors and TAs, alongside with practice problems, lecture slides, guided videos and assignments. The course material is well delivered with clear explanations and examples. I enjoyed the course!"
3,4,"I took MDM4U Data Management in an Ontario high school before University, I so I was already familiar with most of the statistics communication concepts in the course.",1,2,I only know how to import libraries and compile RMD files to PDF. ,3,Doing the module assignment helped me recall knowledge from the lectures so that I understand.

It was extremely useful and laid a solid foundation for my subsequent related statistical courses.,Agree,"I do agree that the information chart assignment is a very good way to discuss, learn and apply the knowledge with the members together.","The most interesting part is discussing and completing homework together with group members. The challenging aspect is that sometimes people's thoughts and viewpoints may differ, and mutual adjustment and understanding are needed among us. My suggestion is that when dealing with group assignments, one should maintain a positive attitude and keep in touch with group members. One should also be proactive in presenting one's own opinions while respecting others' viewpoints.",This course has enabled me to gain a certain understanding of the related concepts of statistics. The entire semester's study has been an unforgettable experience for me.

My TA was able to guide us through the concepts well and explain how to solve problems properly.,I read the comments.,Agree,"The examples given in the course were usually real-world examples. Thus, I was able to see the relevance of doing statistics and how without it our lives would be much harder to grasp and understand.",Agree,"I agree because an infographic requires a certain style and the need for statistical concepts to be communicated clearly. Thus, practicing this helped me improve this ability.","I enjoyed working on the R part of the assignment the most. I enjoyed looking at the Song data and seeing how the statistics turned out. The challenges I encountered was mostly at first trying to get the group organized and everyone familiar with what was happening. It was only resolved after we decided on a platform to use and come together as a group. For future students, I advise that they try as soon as possible to get into contact with their group members and familiarize yourself with the assignment as well.","I think that during my time in this course that I have learnt a lot and had a good learning experience. However, I think the only thing that hindered this was, in my opinion, the large amount of course material and how many slides there were for each module. It took a lot of time to get through each and understand all the concepts."
1,4,"I now know how to interpret statistical tables, specifically, the quartiles, mean, standard deviations, and medians. I also know how to interpret different types of random variables and their distributions. In addition, I can find the proportions of a given event, and use sampling and resampling techniques to find corresponding proportions for those samples. ",1,3,"It was very hard for me navigate the Rstudio platform when I first started the course. However, now, I know how to upload files, import modules, and to export the results of the code through the knit function. ",4,"Each assignment allowed me to apply the content from the modules on my own without the professor telling me all the answers like in lecture, so I was able to better understand each content after doing the assignments.",5,"For each question on the tutorial worksheet, my TA explained the relevant concepts before attempting the problem, which helped me understand the concept better.

Through the course module, I was able to learn about how to make infographics, and about some of the right ways and wrong ways to incorporate data, so that I can make mine the best as possible, with information that is easy to understand for everyone.","I enjoyed making the actual infographic, and thinking about what kind of visuals to include. A challenge that I did encounter though before creating the infographic, is thinking about how to extend on the data that we were given, as the only information given to us about the songs were the distribution of their duration and the word cloud of the most used words in the lyrics. We as a group really had to think about what other information could be included so that the infographic does not only contain the statistical analysis. An advice that I would give to future students is to be creative, and try to find interesting things in the data by yourself as well, instead of just relying on the data given. ","Through the assignments in this course, I was able to learn more about how to analyze a given data, and interpret it in the context of the given situation. I enjoyed this course, and I also really liked that the assignments and the examples given in the lectures were realistic, which allowed me to realize the importance of statistical analysis in the real world. "

Additionally, if I ever needed clarification for the concepts included in a homework assignment, the TA would always be very helpful.",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Strongly agree,"Many of the statistical examples included on the slides were real-world examples, so that trait really helped me understand the relevance of each statistical concept as it was introduced. To add on to this, the homework assignments were also usually based on a real-life event, so that helped me easily understand the concepts' usefulness.",Agree,"Sometimes, a few group members would not communicate very much, but the ones who did helped me narrow down what statistical information would be most important to a wider audience. Furthermore, as the infographic had a word limit, we had to improve our ability to concisely explain the importance of our statistical finding to someone who may not have that strong of a statistical background.","I really enjoyed picking and choosing which statistics would be the most interesting to display, and playing around with the visual layout of the infographic. Some challenges I encountered were certain group members not communicating very much when me and other group members reached out, but that was easily resolved after we discussed the situation with our TA.  Honestly, I would advise any future student to get started on the assignment as early as possible so they have as much as time as possible to put together an effective infographic, and resolve any conflicts if they arise.","Overall, I think I gained a deeper understanding of how to actually interpret the significance of a given statistic under a practical, real-life context, and learnt how to communicate my findings in a way that was easily understandable by others. Furthermore, I think I increased my speed at effectively calculating statistical values, like standard deviations and expected values, which was always a big help.

After taking this course, it's taught me how to apply my various newfound statistical knowledge to compute, graph, and display various statistics from a wide range of data sets. ",4,"I believe that the assignments help me greatly with my understanding. Working on an assignment that tests my knowledge of a certain skill will reinforce the concept in my mind and help me know I'm on the right page. Furthermore, if there's something I don't understand on the assignment I know what gaps in my understanding I have to study.",4,"Much like the assignments, I believe that the tutorials helped my strengthen my understanding as well. Not only did it reinforce my knowledge, but if I didn't understand a concept I had my TA and my peers to help me work through it together.","I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Strongly agree,"I believe that the statistical examples helped me to understand the usefulness of statistics in real life. I often find people asking ""what use is this in the 'real world'"" in concerns to mathematical fields, so having real world examples to work on is incredibly useful and shows the practicality of statistics in my daily life. ",Strongly agree,"I like the infographic activity because it again showed the usefulness of statistics in real life applications. Using the data we gained from the discussion post and being able to filter out the relevant information, and then present it in a way that the public would be interested in is interesting and valuable in many professional settings. ","I enjoyed working on the information aspects of the infographic, as everyone's opinions on what could be generalized or used was shown clearly in our project. Our end product ended up being a collaboration of all of our opinions, voices, and understanding of the course content.

A challenge that we encountered was how to make the infographic's visuals appealing. Since we all had different ideas of how to format it, we chose something we all agreed looked nice, instead of what we believed looked the best.

Advice I would give to future students who will be working on a collaborative assingment in a statistics course is to communicate effectively with your peers so that nobody will have to take on an unreasonable work load nor rush the work last minute. ",This course has heightened my understanding of the subject of statistics. It has done so by teaching me new concepts and exemplifying these new concepts in my daily life. I would describe my overall learning experience as enjoyable.

The main challenge we encountered was inconsistent schedules among team members and low communication efficiency. We collaborated by using shared documents and regular online meetings and successfully completed the assignment.

I recommend that future students start dividing the work as early as possible, clarify everyone's responsibilities, and maintain timely communication, so that collaborative assignments can be completed more efficiently.","This course helped me gain a deeper understanding of the basic concepts and practical applications of statistics by combining real-life cases, chart analysis, and group work tasks. I not only learned how to calculate and interpret data, but also how to evaluate the relationship between data and effectively communicate statistical information. In the overall learning process, I gradually went from being unfamiliar with statistics to understanding and being proficient in it, which improved my logical thinking and data literacy. The course content was practical, and the tasks were challenging but also very rewarding."
4,4,"Assuming that 3 is the avg a student, I placed myself at a 4 mostly because I gained a lot of knowledge regarding statistics from this course.",2,2,"In this course, the only thing I have manipulated in R is seed number and some strings so I am not very confident in my abilities regarding R. I have slightly dabbled with a ""data"" language prior to the course so I'm not totally lost(that would be a 1)",4,The assignments are well-crafted in terms of teaching one a certain topic regarding stats. Not a 5 because after each assignment I wouldn't have fully mastered the topic and will have to go back and read more about it later.,4,"Each tutorial is a great rundown on the topic with excellently prepared questions, it is certainly greatly educational, however it doesn't exactly drill enlightenment into someone(that would be a 5).",I took a quick look at the comments at the end.,Strongly agree,"The examples do indeed show the usefulness, relevance, and value in learning and doing statistics.",Agree,In a lot of ways the infographic assignment has boosted my ability to communicate statistical information.,"I enjoyed piecing together the data in a way in which it flows and is presented in a alluring way.

 

A challenge I encountered would be coordinating the group. I resolved this issue by setting up some meetings and set the project up in a way in which it allowed for asynchronous work to be done.

 

An advice I would give to future students who will be working on a collaborative assignment in a statistics course would be to be available(as much as feasible).",This course has contributed a great amount to my understand of the subject of statistics. The overall learning experience is very smooth compared to a lot of other courses.

Because the professor spend too much time on coding in the lectures, but we do not need it in exam. Gradually, I dont wanna attend lectures."
1,4,"I had never taken any statistics courses prior to this course (I did not take data management in high school), so I had little to no ability to communicate statistics. However, the homework assignments and tutorials helped me develop how to analyze and interpret statistics better.",1,3,"I had never used R before this course. This course was my first exposure and introduction to R. By the end of the course, I've developed adequate skills to decently understand R-scripts, and good skills at reading R outputs.",4,"Sometimes the lecture material can be hard to digest (especially in the later modules such as modules 8, 9, and 10), but the weekly homework assignments help me visualize and piece information in a logical manner such that I can solidify and apply what I learned during lecture while clearing any misunderstanding. The majority of the time, I had lecture slides and practice question solutions open in the background while I completed the homework assignments so that I could refer to them and better understand how everything connected. ",4,"I'd usually try to start a rough draft of weekly assignments before tutorials happen, and the tutorials would cover similar questions that the weekly assignments simulate. Hence, the tutorials have really helped me better understand weekly assignments and thus the course modules. Moreover, my TA, John, did a good job explaining in-depth how to set up each question such that we'd be successful in answering the worksheet. Lastly, some tutorials provided extra examples that apply the ""harder"" concepts of modules in a more comprehensive and digestible way. ",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Strongly agree,"It was interesting to see how statistics can be used to model so many real-life situations.

I feel like it was a nice break and final assignment that differed from the more logical and rigorous weekly assignments 

some challenges that occur was the planning and splitting up of the workload. It was a little difficult to communicate the ideas we all had for the infographic and try to incorporate the best of our ideas such that everyone felt like they contributed fairly

try to team up with people you know (even if you've only talked to them a few times). Communication is a crucial component of this assignment. Hence, being able to communicate easily can help the process run more smoothly","This course has definitely increased my appreciation for the subject of statistics and the rigor that is behind it. Due to this, I was more compelled to learn more. I attended every lecture, and that definitely helped my understanding since I got to listen to more in-depth explanations of the ""why"" behind the computations.

I had to decide which details were essential and which would just confuse our audience.,"I  enjoyed brainstorming visualizations with my group. Debating which charts would best show our findings was actually fun! 

The biggest challenge was coordinating schedules. We ended up creating a shared Google doc where we could work asynchronously and leave comments. 

For future students: start early and divide tasks based on strengths. Some people are better at data analysis while others at visual design. ","This course shifted how I view data in everyday life. Before, I'd just accept statistics at face value, but now I automatically question sample sizes and look for potential biases.

I feel a lot more comfortable exploring data on my own and can actually explain statistical concepts to others without getting confused myself."

Statistics can be applied outside the classroom. Whether it was analyzing survey data, interpreting probabilities, or understanding trends through regression, the course consistently showed how statistical thinking can be valuable in a wide range of fields.

 ",Strongly agree,I agree with this statement. The infographic assignment challenged me to not only understand the statistical information but also present it in a way that is clear and accessible to a general audience.,"Working collaboratively on the infographic assignment was a valuable learning experience. It gave me the opportunity to apply statistical concepts in a creative and practical way, while also learning how to communicate data clearly to a general audience. Start early and communicate often. Make sure everyone in the group understands the statistical concepts before jumping into the design, so the final infographic is both accurate and meaningful. ","This course has significantly deepened my understanding of statistics, both in terms of theory and real-world application. I gained a solid foundation in key concepts such as probability, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and data visualization. "
3,3,"I rated my ability to communicate statistics higher after the course because I gained more confidence in explaining statistical concepts clearly. The course helped me understand how to present data effectively and use appropriate terminology, which improved both my understanding and communication skills.",3,3,"I gave myself a higher rating after the course because I became more confident using R for data analysis. Through the course, I learned how to write basic R scripts, clean and visualize data, and interpret outputs. I now feel more comfortable navigating the software and applying it to real statistical problems.",3,"I gave myself a 3 because I understood most of the key concepts, but some topics were still a bit tricky. Sometimes I had to go over the materials more than once or look things up to really get it. The weekly assignments helped, but I wouldn’t say I’ve mastered everything yet.",3,"I chose a 3 because the tutorials helped me understand some of the concepts better, especially when they were explained step-by-step. But not everything clicked right away—some parts were still a bit confusing, so I wouldn’t say I fully understood everything just from the tutorials.",I read the comments.,Agree,"I agree because the statistical examples made the concepts more relatable and easier to understand. Seeing how statistics are used in real-life situations helped me appreciate their relevance and applications beyond just formulas and calculations. It made the learning process more engaging and meaningful.

 ",Agree,"I agree because the infographic assignment helped me learn how to present complex statistical concepts in a more visual and understandable way. It made me think critically about what information was most important and how to explain it clearly to others, especially for audiences without a strong background in statistics.","One part I really enjoyed was working with my group to come up with ideas. Everyone had different thoughts, and it was fun to find a creative way to show the stats clearly. We split the work based on what each person was good at, which helped a lot.

The main challenge we had was finding time to work together because our schedules were different. We fixed that by using shared docs and group chats to stay in touch and keep the project moving.

My advice for future students is to start early and talk to your group often. Don’t wait until the last minute, and don’t be afraid to ask questions or share your ideas. Working together gets easier when everyone communicates.","This course helped me understand how statistics work in real life, not just in theory. I learned how to collect data, analyze it, and explain the results in a meaningful way. The examples and assignments made it easier to see why statistics are useful in many fields.

Overall, my learning experience was positive. Some parts were challenging at first, but the course materials and support made it easier to follow. I feel more confident now using statistical tools and thinking critically about data."
4,4,"I rated my ability to communicate statistics as a 4 because this course significantly improved my understanding and confidence in discussing statistical concepts. Before taking it, I assumed statistics was mainly about probability calculations. However, I discovered it covers a wide range of topics like z-scores, interquartile range (IQR), sampling distributions, and hypothesis testing (e.g., null and alternative hypotheses). These concepts opened my eyes to the depth and practical relevance of statistics. I feel much more capable of explaining these ideas now, though I still see room for growth in mastering and communicating more advanced topics.",4,4,"I rated my ability to use R as a 4 because before this course, I had no experience at all with the software. Throughout the class, I learned how to use R for a variety of tasks—like  visualizing data using ggplot2, and performing statistical tests such as t-tests and linear regression. It was challenging at first, but over time, I became more comfortable writing scripts and interpreting outputs. Learning R has been really important to me because it bridges the gap between theory and application—it allows me to actually do statistics, not just learn about it. I still have more to explore, but this course gave me a solid foundation that I’m excited to build on.",4,"I would rate my understanding as a 4 because the weekly assignments helped reinforce what I learned in class. They provided a good refresher on key statistical concepts and allowed me to apply the theories in practical, real-world contexts, which deepened my understanding.",5,"I would rate my understanding as a 5. The tutorials were really helpful—they were similar to test questions, which gave me valuable practice. They also helped me learn how to properly use the equations, reinforcing both the concepts and their applications.",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Strongly agree,"The statistical examples illustrated in this course strongly helped me recognize the usefulness, relevance, and value of learning and applying statistics. They showed how statistical concepts can be used to interpret real-world situations, which made the learning experience more meaningful and practical.",Strongly agree,"I strongly agree that the infographic assignment improved my ability to communicate statistical information clearly and effectively.

What aspects of this assignment did you enjoy working on?

I really enjoyed the collaborative nature of the infographic assignment. It gave me the opportunity to meet new people and make friends, which was a refreshing experience—especially since it was my first time working on a group project at UTM. The group discussions were fun and engaging, and it was nice to see how everyone brought different strengths to the table. There was a strong sense of teamwork and mutual support, which made the experience enjoyable and less stressful.

 

What challenges did you encounter, and how did you resolve them?

One of the main challenges we faced was coordinating everyone’s schedules and making sure we were all on the same page, especially with different deadlines and workloads. There were also moments when certain parts of the assignment were unclear or when someone was stuck on something. We resolved these issues by setting up group calls and even meeting up in person at school. These sessions were very productive because we could help each other in real time and make sure everyone understood their part. The willingness of team members to support one another really helped us overcome obstacles smoothly.

 

What advice would you give to future students who will be working on a collaborative assignment in a statistics course?

Plan ahead and clearly divide responsibilities early on. Make sure there’s open communication, and always respond to your teammates’ messages—it really helps things run smoothly.","This course has significantly deepened my understanding of statistics by connecting theoretical concepts to real-world applications. The lectures, assignments, and tutorials worked together to reinforce key ideas like probability, data interpretation, and hypothesis testing. I especially appreciated how the course encouraged critical thinking and showed the relevance of statistics in everyday life, whether through analyzing datasets or creating the infographic project. The hands-on components, such as using formulas and interpreting results, helped me build practical skills and confidence. Overall, my learning experience was very positive—I felt supported by the structure of the course and the collaborative opportunities it provided. Working with others and practicing how to communicate statistical findings also made the subject more engaging and meaningful. I now feel more capable of understanding and applying statistical concepts in both academic and real-world settings."
3,3,"I feel like this course doesn't really teach how to communicate statistics, so for me I feel like my ability to communicate statistics is still the same",2,3,"This course does not explain how to use R well. However, it explains how to read statistics results from R.",3,"All weekly assignments are okay. Some of them explain well, but some of them not.",3,The tutorial doesn't really explain it well,"I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Neither agree nor disagree,"For the first 5 modules, it I understood it really well, and it quite useful. However, the rest are hard to understand.",Agree,Making infographics must be interesting so it attracts the reader and not bored.,"I enjoy making it and designing it because it also makes me learn about statistics. However, I don't like that the assignment is in groups because I prefer to work alone. But other than that, it's fine. I think making it a group should be optional because there's sometimes a member in the group who doesn't work and gets carried / free score from the rest of the members.","This course is okay, I rate it 6.5/10. Things can be improved, such as making the lecture more interesting, not bunch of text on the slides. and maybe by doing some live experiments during lectures if necessary like we did with cards on tutorial to make the students engage with the learning activity."
2,4,"The module slides and lectures really enriched my learning compared to the readings for each module. The readings were used to introduce you into the module, and the slides were used to further experiment and explore these topics. During lecture, we learned where specific formulas were derived from, as well as how these topics are connected with other modules as well. I think the greatest takeaway from this course is how each topic/branch of statistics all relate to one another. Typically in math courses, you learn about a subject and move on, an example of this is the topic of volumes using integrals and summation/series. With statistics, the topics you learn in class are a bit if not very related to each topic. This gives a feeling of linear progression rather than a sudden drop in knowledge, experience and confidence.",1,2,"I am now able to read most R inputs, however I am not able to complete these R inputs on my own. Learning how to use the R language wasn't a main focus for this course, and so most ""learning"" I did was reading the assignment codes and connecting them to the video. Using this method I have a fair understanding of how libraries, plots, tables and graphs are used, although I don't have the ability to create meaningful outputs from scratch.",4,"The weekly assignments were a great ""finisher"" for each module. I typically used these assignments to put my knowledge to the test and apply what I had learned from this weeks module. These assignments were well written enough to provide helpful ""hints"" as to what we had learned in the module. The assignments could be used as both a final ""test"" for well prepared students to show what they have learned from this weeks material, but it can also be used as a small idea as to what we have learned in the weeks module.",3,"There isn't much time for the TA to go over slides, activities and the weekly assessment, and thus my TA quickly summarized the slides, gave us our assessment paper and taught the class if they had any questions. Because of limited time, the material taught in tutorials are very surface level where students who had not come to class were basically copying the formulas onto their paper and applying the calculations, losing the students opportunity to understand why we use these formulas and how they work.",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Agree,"At first, I wondered why we had so much examples that came from real life data. I thought ""Why can't the professor find random artificial data ? It saves the professor some time from looking for sources, and also the goal of each module is to show that we have been paying attention to this weeks module, right?"" But I was wrong. Unlike mathematics, no one's gonna force you to use statistics. Statistics is something that is hidden in the world around you, it's not something you necessarily have to think about in your daily life, and you will be perfectly fine without using statistics and probability at all. But like every educational subject, statistics enriches the world around you and makes you think at a deeper level. This type of critical thinking exercises our minds and allows us to be sharp when making decisions. Your reasoning comes from your education and experience, and statistics is another subject that will subconsciously elevate the complexity of your life. I now realize that these examples were used to train our intuition, and that maybe in the future, when we look at a billboard our brains may start to subconsciously think about the probability of this data.",Strongly agree,"As I stated before, statistics isn't a necessity in life, however it is useful to keep in mind. The modules we have learned in this course shows that a lot of the data in the real world can be interpreted using many different kinds of tools. The intuition you build from this class goes a long way in learning how to tackle each different question! After doing questions from each module, there are subtle hints you gain from each question (whether intentional or not), and this helps to confirm whether our answer is confidently correct or not!","I most particularly enjoyed working on the infographic on the assignment. There was no ""leading""  and we were throwing ideas at each other and we had each contributed equally to the infographic. Everyone had a good time working on the infographic, there was one moment where everyone was silently making small corrections to the infographic. During that time I didn't feel isolated and lonely, rather I felt content that everyone was working on the infographic independently without the need of saying anything.

Advice I would give to future students is that templates are very useful! Of course try to add your own spin to it, but sometimes the blank empty space is what demotivates you from starting your infographic, and replacing that with colorful and aesthetic icons, fonts and titles gives inspiration as to what your infographic can look like.","The course contributed to my overall understanding as it allowed me to interpret the world's data in a more statistical standpoint. I am now able to further understand data given to me and just how important the field of statistics is to the world. My overall learning experience in this course has been wonderful, I was able to explore the field of statistics further than what my high school education has provided me. Coming from a smaller province in Canada, we didn't have statistics as a course, and as such I was pretty excited to learn about the field and the works around it. Unlike other fields, I felt somewhat connected and familiar with the questions, and I assume that is because most real world questions can be interpreted as statistics questions. This course has been wonderful, I am extremely grateful for how well coordinated and student-aware this course is!"

But in my opinion, it is easier to learn from video explanations.",5,"Tutorial is really useful to me because it really simplify the materials and if there were anything confusing about it, we can just ask the teaching assistant.","I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,"I think from examples, I learnt how in real life, a lot of statistics are normal distribution by nature. Then I realized the usefulness of learning how to take the middle more accurately than just by median/average. We can even use estimation for the middle.",Agree,It helps us simplify terms or analogies that could only be understood by students that have learned statistics to a more general language that everyone can understand.,"I enjoy collaborating with others, proposing an idea and discussing about it together as a group from different backgrounds. The only challenge was to get everyone in the same page. That is why the discussion happens and eventually we will get to a point where we all agree. 

An advice for future students on collaborative assignment, is to pick your own groupmates and start early.",Overall I understood the topic really well. Learning experience was not as high as my expectation but it was okay.
3,3,"My wording is often not complete enough when completing the purpose of this task part of the assignment, so my ability to communicate statistics still needs to be improved.",3,3,"i can understand the code in R, but i do not have the ability to coding.",4,"the weekly assignments can help me understand some knowledge by the real examples, it is helpful.",4,the weekly tutorial helps me understand and do the weekly assignments better.,I read the comments.,Agree,"The statistical examples in the course slides show real-world applications of statistics, giving me a more intuitive understanding of their utility, relevance, and value.",Agree,the infographic assignment let me know how to use normal words to explain statistical information to people who do not have statistical background.,"The aspect of this assignment I enjoy working on is making the poster together.

At the start of the assignment, we struggled since we did not know what we should do as the first step. The group discussion helps us solve the problem. 

Communication between group members is important.","The course before the midterm is easier for me to understand than that after the midterm. And I think if the slides could have some ""keywords,"" it would be better. Overall, I really enjoy the learning experience."
4,3,My ability of communicating statistics in class is a little bit slower than the after class. Therefore I need to learn more time after class to better understand the statistics.,3,4,The ability of using R software has been increased through this class and my using of R can be slow in class because I need to pay attention to the knowledge teaching in class. After class I will pay more attention on the using of R.,4,I think I can understand the concepts of each module well but sometimes I can't combine the knowledge well with the R homework. And sometimes I feel confused with what I must to write to show my understanding in my homework.,5,Participating the tut class really helps me to better understand the concept and I can practice more through tut.,"I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,I looked the TA's feedback to see what need to learn more. The statistics examples are really important and they can better help me to understand the statistics concepts.,Neither agree nor disagree,"This task can increase my ability of making data visual through canva but the process of communicating is really difficulty and the time is close to final, many people are busy with their work so it can be harder for people to do group work in this time.",I really enjoy the experience of communicating with each other. I met the challenges that the difficulty of communicating with others but I resist to doing that and finally we finished it. My advice is to be patient with your group members.,This course contributed to my understanding of the subject of statistics from building the basic statistics concepts from different modules and knowing how to use the basic functions of R software which can provide me with large amount of data. My overall learning experience is great because it's very clear and it's also very useful.
2,4,"I learned how to describe sample distributions, calculate means, and standard deviations. I have also learnt to analysis box plots, histograms, etc. With these graphs I can describe the shape, centre and distribution very well, and I can clearly explain the concepts of ‘what does this interval represent’ and ‘the relationship between the sample and the population’. I learnt how to do simulations in R studio and I was able to express ‘what does this CI tell us’. When interpreting results, I was able to put into words ‘uncertainty’ and ‘range of confidence’.",1,3,"Before starting the course, I had never worked with R. I was unfamiliar with the syntax, basic commands, and how to use RStudio. at first, I struggled with even the most basic operations. By the end of the semester I had some knowledge of R, but still couldn't code myself. I can change seed numbers and names. I can also use R to write analyses and then generate pdfs. However, I still need to continue to strengthen my understanding of R.",4,"After completing each weekly assignment, I felt that my understanding of the statistical concepts improved significantly. I was able to understand the purpose of the assignment, apply what I learned, and explain results clearly. Since I’m still solidifying my confidence with some more advanced topics, I would rate my understanding as 4 out of 5.",5,"TA was very serious in taking us through the points and giving us a better understanding, so I think tutorial is very useful. ",I read the comments.,Agree,"I agree that the statistical examples in this course helped me appreciate the real-world relevance of statistics. For example, analyzing the shell lengths of sea turtles and constructing bootstrap confidence intervals made me realize how statistics can support meaningful conclusions even with uncertainty. Also, the assignment about Benford's Law, we learnt that in many real-world datasets, smaller digits like 1 appear in the first place more often than larger digits like 9. It's something I don't notice at all in my daily life. I remember that this law can also identify whether financial data is real or not.",Strongly agree,"I think the infographics assignment improved my ability to communicate statistical information. This process not only helped me practice how to present data visually, but also how to describe patterns and results in a way that others could understand. I also strengthened my communication and comprehension skills during discussions with my group members. Because it was easy for me to understand the data on my own, it was challenging to explain it to others and make them understand.","It's interesting to present the conclusions in infographic form. It's more enjoyable than just used R studio.

One challenge we faced was agreeing on which dataset to use, since everyone had different ideas at first. To resolve this, we took time to explain the pros and cons of each option and finally voted on the one that felt most manageable and relevant. We also asked TAs and professors for their opinions. Since two of the panelists hadn't done posters or anything like that at all, they didn't know much about infographics. We had a lot of design conflicts, but in the end we all agreed.

Communicate clearly and early. If you're confused about something, don't be afraid to say so - it's likely that others are confused about the same thing. Try to choose people who you know well so that communication is easier. If the group doesn't listen while having no insight into the work, communication can be tiring. Also, allow enough time for team members to edit and review the final infographic together. 

 ","Before taking this course, I had a very weak background in statistics, which I thought was mostly about doing calculations and memorising formulas. But this course changed my perception. The infographics really taught me how statistics connects to the real world and how important it is to communicate clearly. Overall, my learning experience was very positive. Although I struggled a little with the R studio and new concepts at first, I felt supported by TA and gradually became more confident. "
2,4,"The course materials and structure are relatively straightforward, so it is not that hard to study the concepts. However, it is not exactly clear—stemming from the course structure and focus of the material—how to fully and effectively apply these skills to an abstract real-world example.",1,2,"I did not focus on studying R, as it seemed—and was—not helpful for the assessments and course content. The most I have done is recognize the formatting of tables in R to apply to the first midterm, and I have learned how to edit and compile R code. However, I would not be able to write my own R code if asked to do so at the moment.",3,"The weekly assignments, I believe helped a little in refreshing the concepts done during the weekly lectures.",2,"The weekly tutorial structure was strange, to say the least. While the worksheets given out during the tutorials were expected to be completed independently and were graded, the limited time allocated to review them made the tutorials feel more like a race to copy the TA's answers. I believe that if the tutorials were marked for attendance only, rather than grading the worksheets, it would be more beneficial. This way, students could focus on genuinely attempting the problems on their own, instead of waiting around for the TA to go over the answers just so they can copy them down out of concern for their grades. I believe this approach is detrimental to learning, as tutorials should serve as opportunities to apply the concepts learned in lectures.","I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,The statistical examples were satisfactory for the concepts we learned.,Strongly disagree,The infographic assignment is too abstract. Attempting to analyze some data and trying to identify patterns did not help me build skills related to the course content in a meaningful way.,"A challenge I encountered while working on this assignment was coordinating communication with group members in a timely manner. It was sometimes difficult to get responses and arrange meeting times—both in-person and online—since everyone had different schedules, unlike the more consistent routine in high school.

My advice to future students would be to plan group meetings several days in advance. Trying to schedule something only a day or two ahead may not give everyone enough time to respond, and it’s helpful to allow for some delays in communication, just in case. Being proactive with planning can really make the group work experience smoother.

 ","This course helped me gain a better understanding of the subject of statistics. However, I believe the overall learning experience was not entirely positive. While the course materials were generally fine, I found that the way some of the content was delivered—such as through tutorials and online assignments—was not particularly beneficial to my learning. As a result, I often had to rely heavily on self-study to grasp the concepts."

However, many of them could be understood.",4,I think the weekly assignment is very meaningful. It is helpful to understand statistical concepts by generating charts with code.,4,I really like weekly tutorial very much because it is truly very practical and it further consolidates the knowledge learned in the lectures.,"I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Strongly agree,"Although this is an introductory course of statistics, it is very practical. It enables a person like me, who has never been exposed to statistics before, to understand the practical significance of statistics.",Strongly agree,"The infographic assignment requires the application of understanding of the course to complete. It is very meaningful and we need to read, interpret and discuss it.","I enjoy answering the questions in this assignment. These questions all require the application of the knowledge learned in the course, which can help me better absorb such knowledge. 

I'm not quite sure about the analysis of some charts, but our team members communicated actively with each other and reached the conclusion together.

I think it is essential to master the key points of this lesson well, so that we can be more efficient when doing collaborative assignments.","This course truly opened the door to statistics for me and enabled me to understand the significance of statistics. At the beginning, I found many statistical concepts difficult to grasp. However, after concentrated study, I increasingly realized how interesting this course is."

2,4,"Before I have this course I can only communicate a little sta in Chinese. STA07 has helped me build a strong foundation in communicating statistical ideas. I can clearly explain the story behind data using the professional methods I learned, and present results in both writing and speaking. My statistics languages and vocabulary also improved a lot from attending classes and doing R assignment.",1,3,"I knew nothing about R before I took this couse. This couse helped me build a solid foundation in using R to solve questions. Now I can understand R code, edit and run them to get the results ( e.g. plots). But the room for my improvement in R is still large, I will keep on developing my skills in using it.",4,"The assignments for each module were moderately challenging, which helped reinforce the key concepts we learnt. Although we didn’t need to write code ourselves, using R through tutorials and assignments really deepened my understanding. It’s a very useful tool for learning statistics, and working with it made the concepts more practical and easier to grasp.",5,"The tutorials were very helpful in reviewing the lecture content and applying it to specific examples.

It was also a chance to work with my friends, discuss ideas, and collaborate, which made the learning process more engaging and effective.","* I was responsible for data analysis, which gave me the chance to apply what we learned in class. Analyzing the data by reading graphs and interpreting the R code was the foundation of our project. I also really enjoyed the process of designing the infographic—it was both creative and rewarding.

* One challenge we faced was deciding how to organize and present our results clearly on the poster. There was a lot of information, and we weren’t sure what to include or leave out. After discussing it with my group members, we shared ideas and worked together to find a balanced and clear way to present our key points.

* Communicate actively with your group members—collaboration is really important. Be open to listening to different perspectives, and make sure everyone is on the same page throughout the process. Working as a team can make the project smoother and more enjoyable.","This course has helped me build a strong foundation in statistics and introduced me to many important terms and concepts. What I enjoyed the most was using R to analyze real-world problems—it made the learning more practical and engaging. Professor Asal and my TA Louisianne were both very helpful and supportive throughout the course. I think the course was well-designed, and I really enjoyed the overall experience. I just wish we had more opportunities to practice writing R code ourselves, as it would help deepen our understanding even further."

I also enjoy working with my team to decide which message is most important and how best to convey it.

One of the challenges we faced was coordinating our schedules and agreeing on a final design. Everyone has a slightly different view, so it will take some discussion and compromise to reach an agreement. To address this, we divide tasks according to individual strengths and establish regular checks to make sure we are on the same page.

For prospective students, I recommend that they make communication a priority as early as possible. Start projects early, assign roles clearly, and use tools like Canva to keep everything organized. Collaboration is truly beneficial when everyone contributes and stays in sync.","This course helped me lay a solid foundation in understanding how to analyze, interpret data and use R. Not only did I learn how to do basic statistical calculations, but I also learned how to apply them to real life situations.

And using the R markdown to complete the Infographic was an interesting task as well, and I enjoyed it.","Once again, I enjoy how we all talked in statistical terms and communicated to take parts on the assignment. I enjoyed designing the Infographic poster as well, as this is my first time designing a infographic it was interesting. I feel like it used other part of my brain for thinking. The challenges I would say for this assignment was trying to contact our teammates, what would have helped was in tutorial class the TA could group up the team members and tell them to come infant and tell them to sit together. My advice would be to contact them as soon as possible and talk to the TA if you could not contact them, which Im pretty sure the TA would help. ","I feel like this course gave me a very strong foundation on statistics. My overall learning experience was good, however the lectures once again could be improved; I feel like I learned more from online researching myself and understanding them. But overall it was enjoyable."
2,4,"Before coming to this class, I feel like many people know basic probability just by using logic, ie if I flip a coin its a 50-50 chance of heads vs tails. But now after taking this course we can explain using logic and math also more complicated, like what is the probability of me getting 10 coin flips in a row.",1,4,"I did not know about R software for probability, but I feel like I could improve more by learning how the actual code works. ",3,Assignments helped me understand the topic better via simulations and also the questions.,4,"Tutorials are kinda like test questions and help you experiment with your abilities, and having a TA explain things also helps",I took a quick look at the comments at the end.,Agree,"Yeah I felt like after learning some entry level stats in this course, I noticed how much it is applicable in the real world.",Agree,Yeah infographics rely on certain statistical elements where I learned how to communicate statistical findings in a easy to interpret way.,"Just looking at all the sample infographics and how they are effective, challenges were communicating and getting group members to work on certain things, resolve via talking with others( both in person and online). Advice is to always start early and to split up the tasks, since usually group assignments result in poor distribution of work among group members.","Overall this course was a good start to learning elementary level statistics, overall was a good experience. Can make something like stats which is supposedly boring actually interesting and applicable to the real world."
5,5,i am a highly capable person.,5,5,same，study by myself,5,i understand everything，because itis a bird course,5,help a lot，my ta explain everything in detail.,I didn't read the comments.,Neither agree nor disagree,i think stats is boring and meaningless,Strongly disagree,it's waste of time. this bird course doesn't worth any group work.,this course has so much meaningless part，everyone should learn it in 1 week instead of 4 months. ,it let me know i dont want to do any stats. stats is boring to me.
3,5,The course was designed to help me improve my ability to communicate statistics！,1,4,I've barely touched R code and this class was very helpful in getting started with it!,4,"Since this was my first statistics class, I had fun learning it. But I didn't do well in the exam, maybe because I didn't learn the knowledge firmly.",5,Tutorial is very helpful! thanks to my TA Daniel!,I read the comments.,Strongly agree,Each assignment has its interesting research points and associated statistics.,Strongly agree,I enjoy I communicating with my groupmates when we are trying to figure out a problem from the infographic assignment.,"I was mainly responsible for the division of tasks, the proposal of the program and the completion of the coding part. I really like the feeling when assigning work to team members, it makes me feel needed.

 

We were making infographs and realized that there was so much data that we couldn't put every single one into our charts. It occurred to me that we could resize the data and present it in the chart in an irregular manner. Eventually it occurred to me that a bar chart was a most visual way to react to the amount of data, so I replaced the bar with the text itself for each piece of data, defining how often they appeared in terms of SIZE, and finally completing the chart. I think my group and I did a great job.

 

Keep contacting, and keep thinking","Statistics is the art of numbers, so it's rigorous. Sometimes, understanding a point itself will be much more important than doing lots and lots of questions."
2,4,"I didn’t take stats in highschool so I wasn’t well informed on the subject. But now, I am well educated due to this intro course. Alas, my statistical knowledge has improved greatly. Thank you.",1,3,I never even heard of R before. Now after running R codes and stuff I am decently understanding. But I haven’t written any code really so there is lots of room for improvement .,5,The weekly assignments were very helpful in connecting real life situations to statistics. Thank you.,3,The tutorials were pretty helpful sometimes. But I find that I learn better alone usually.,I read the comments.,Strongly agree,Connecting real life to statistics really helped me understand how important statistics are and really helped me choose my future major (statistics).,Strongly disagree,I don’t like infographics. I also don’t like assignments. I also don’t like being put in a group with people because I don’t like people. ,"I don't like collaborating. Too much reliance on others. I like being in control.

The advice I would give is to get started early and work more as a group than individually doing each section.,"I learned a lot, every part played a part in my learning more of statistics. Most of my classes the tutorials feel pointless however these tutorial sessions were very important to me in my learning journey."
4,4,"How would you rate your ability to communicate statistics after the course?

By the end of the course I had developed a strong ability to communicate statistical information. I could clearly explain key data points, trends and factors using both written and verbal language.

They made the concepts more interesting and useful.",Agree,"I chose ""Agree"" because the infographic assignmentt helped me practice reading and explaining statistical results. It also improved my skills in showing data clearly and making it easy to understand for others.","I enjoyed working on the design part of the infographic and choosing how to show the data. It was fun to be creative and work as a team. One challenge we had was finding a time that worked for everyone to meet. We solved it by using group chats and dividing the work clearly. My advice for future students is to start early,  communicate well, and help each other. Working together can be a great experience if everyone does their part.","This course helped me understad statistics better by reaching me how to colect, analyze, and explain data. I also learned how to use R to do different kinds of statistical work. My overall learning experience was positive. The lectures, assignments, and tutorials, all helped me build my kills step by step."
4,5,"After studying statistics, I feel that I have a more convenient and efficient way to analyze data.",3,4,"Although I have no experience in computer science, this does not prevent me from using R to complete my homework, especially our group work, which makes me more proficient in using R.",3,"The weekly homework is more like completing a task, and in comparison, I feel that I can learn more at TUT.",5,"I like our TA ""John Fei"" very much, because he always answers our questions seriously.",I took a quick look at the comments at the end.,Agree,"Statistics is not just a subject, but a tool that has important implications for real life and decision-making processes.",Strongly agree,"I like our group infographic very much, because it involves my favorite music and singers, which makes me very motivated to complete this assignment. As a group manager, I have not only improved my statistical ability, but also strengthened the management of the group.","I would prefer to analyze charts, but I don’t have a good ability to summarize, so I need to improve this aspect. I suggest that future students actively communicate and put forward their own opinions","Learning is endless, and statistics is a development trend in the future. It can analyze past data and predict future development directions. It is as if I can predict the future. This is my favorite aspect of statistics."

I love where there is a mixture of ideas but clearly split roles for each individual and putting all of the good work together. For advice wise, I think just don’t fear to share your ideas and by developing them well, eventually would lead to great results.","My overall experience with this course is decent, though I do have room for improvements in communicating using technical terms and collaborating ideas, I believe I will develop further interest in the realm of statistics."
1,5,"I rated my ability to communicate statistics as a 1 before the course because I had have taken a statistics course before, and had no knowledge about statistics. After the course, I’d rate my ability higher because the structured practice in translating complex ideas, using visualizations, and receiving feedback significantly strengthened my confidence and effectiveness in statistical communication.",1,5,"I had never use the R statistical software before this course, but after taking this course, I build understanding based on our daily homework assignments and had a solid understanding of R now.",4,Each week's homework assignment had clear instructions and is easy to follow up.

They made the ideas easier to understand and helped me see why statistics matters.",Strongly agree,The infographic assignment helped me practice turning numbers into clear visuals and simple explanations. I got better at picking out key points and making stats easier to understand for others.,"I enjoyed working with classmates to design the infographic and analyze the R data together.

We faced challenges like finding meeting times that worked for everyone and deciding which information to include in the infographic. We solved these by being flexible with scheduling and asking our TA or professor for guidance when needed.

Meet in person if possible, and schedule at least two meeting times early on to avoid last-minute conflicts.","The overall learning experience was really good, the professors and TAs were all very patient and answered all my questions in detail. After taking this class, I learned many new statistics concepts and ways to calculate and interpret data, which made me feel more confident working with real-world problems."
2,3,"Through this course, I have deepened my understanding of statistics a bit and am more able to express statistical concepts in simple terms",2,4,"This course has enabled me to master the basic operations of the R language, including data import and simple statistical analyses",3,"The weekly assignments helped me understand the basics of statistical concepts, but some of the content still needs to be practised more and more to be fully  understand",4,"The weekly tutorials helped me to understand the concepts more clearly, especially through the examples and explanations, which deepened my  understanding of key points",I read the comments.,Agree,The statistical examples in the course are close to reality and it nhelp me to understand the value of practical applications of statistics in daily life and professional research,Agree,"By completing the infographic assignment, I learnt how to organise and clearly express complex statistical information, which was helpful in improving my ability to explain the data","I enjoyed the process of designing the infographic with the group, especially when discussing how to present the data more completely.Challenges encountered were time coordination and disagreements, which we resolved through online meetings（use Instagram to make a phone call）

I think my advice to future students would be to start early, have a clear division of labour, and communicate more.","This course has given me a more systematic understanding of statistics, not only mastering the basic concepts and tools (e.g. R), but also being able to understand the application of statistics in reality.The overall learning process was fulfilling and challenging but also fun, and I learned a lot."
3,4,"I would rate my ability to communicate statistics going into the course as 3. Since each class covered a large amount of information, I was able to understand the concepts taught by the professor to a certain extent. However, actively communicating statistical ideas during class remained a challenge for me.

After the Course, I would rate my ability to communicate statistics as 4. Through tutorials and review sessions after class, I have significantly improved in explaining statistical results with clarity and confidence. I can now effectively interpret data using appropriate terminology and present my explanations clearly, which has been reflected in my homework assignments.",4,5,"In my view, R statistical software is relatively easy to use. Going into the course, I was still exploring and familiarizing myself with it. However, with each weekly assignment reinforcing my skills, I have become increasingly proficient in using R. This progress has been a rewarding and fulfilling experience for me.",4,"Weekly assignments are very important for me to understand the statistical concepts in each module! They have allowed me to reinforce the key concepts covered each week, making it easier for me to comprehend and retain the material.",4,"In the weekly tutorial, the teaching assistant would help us summarize the key concepts from each module, giving me a clearer understanding of the statistical concepts. Additionally, the worksheets from the weekly tutorials provided valuable practice, which greatly helped me become familiar with the exam format. Overall, I really appreciate the effort my teaching assistant put into preparing each tutorial!",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Strongly agree,"The feedback from my TA on my worksheets was extremely valuable to me. Whenever I had any questions, I made sure to ask my TA, who was always patient and thorough in providing explanations. I truly appreciate their support!

Additionally, I strongly agree with the statement: “The statistical examples illustrated in this course helped me recognize the usefulness, relevance, and value of learning about and doing statistics.” I think STA107 has been very beneficial, as it has helped me understand how data analysis is used in different fields. Without a doubt, this course is both important and valuable.",Strongly agree,"The infographic assignment was quite challenging for me, but our team members are very good at communication and cooperation, and the cooperation process is very smooth, and everyone can put forward valuable opinions. This assignment allowed me to experience both the challenges of statistics and the charm of  teamwork. Overall, it was a both challenging and enjoyable assignment.","My favorite part of the assignment was working together as a group to create the infographic. It was a really enjoyable process, with everyone actively sharing their ideas, and our discussions were both smooth and efficient.

The main challenge we faced was in the beginning when we were trying to understand what an infographic was. Since it was a completely new type of assignment for us, it took some time to grasp the concept. However, once we became familiar with it, everything went much more smoothly.

For future students working on collaborative assignments, I believe the key is communication. Don’t be afraid of whether your ideas are right or wrong, what matters most is having the confidence to share your thoughts!","In my opinion, STA107 has provided me with a solid foundation in statistics. It has given me a basic understanding of the subject. In addition, through the weekly assignment, has allowed me to see how statistics is applied in real-life situations. Although this course was not a required course for me, it is a very valuable course for me as an elective course. In the future, I may consider taking more statistics-related courses to further develop my interest in the field."
3,4,"Before this course, I already had learned some of the basics of statistics, so the course gave me a mild raise over statistical communications.",1,3,"I did not know what R is before I entered the course, so this course introduced me to this language. However, this course did not focus on using R, so I am still not very familiar with using it.",4,"The assignments are very useful for me, it generated visual explanations for me that better my understanding of the concepts.",5,The tutorials are very helpful since our ta effectively led us through the core concepts and the approach to problems. This let me to be more familiar with the course contents. ,"I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Neither agree nor disagree,"Examples are vital in terms of understanding the course contents. However, I think it’s of the same weight for explaining how the concepts form.",Neither agree nor disagree,"The infographic made me practice how to form statistical sentences, so it did improve my ability to clearly state statistical information, but to a limited extent since this is very similar to weekly assignments.","I enjoy working on gathering the statistical information in this assignment. One challenge I encountered is that I have used the old data set to generate statistical information, and our team created the inforgraphic based on that wrong statistics. I resolved it by rewriting the statistical information. One advice I would give to future students working collaboratively is that start by creating a structure for the assignment then dive in to the details in case of changes in the data set.","This course contributed to my understanding of statistics through enhancing my previous learnt knowledge in statistics, and furthered my perspective on statistics, helping me utilize statistical tools. Overall, my learning experience is pleasant, and it would be even better if there is more challenging contents."
3,4,I rate my ability to communicate statistics going into the course as 3-4. I need to continue to work on communicating statistics to a better level.  I hope I can learn more deeply.,3,4,I rate my ability to use R statistical software after the course is also 3-4. Sometimes I am worried about how to write the code. But for sta107 right now we do not need to know how to write the code. But if we learn more deeply I am worried about how to write the code.,4,"Yes, I rate 4 for this question. Because after completing its weekly assignment this is also a good practice for every module. That's really helpful for me.",4,"The tutorial is a good way to practice. The most important one is the worksheet, which is a good idea.",I read the comments.,Agree,"I read the comments that TA wrote, I need to pay more attention when TA wrote the feedback. But when I have some questions I always connect with my TA.",Agree,"I agree with both questions. Because, the infographic assignment help us how to design and use R. Also increased our ability to work with groups.",Because of infographic assignment that increased our ability to work with groups. Also helps us to have a good start to design. Helps us be more interested in the Sta 107 course. For this assignment the connection people is also a big important thing.,I enjoy this class. I hope i can understand better for future sta class.
2,4,"Statistics is used since middle school. Basic understandings like probability and data of experiments like ""how many times did Timmy score the basketball"", favourable outcomes over total outcomes and most people have basic understandings of the principles but once entering this course learning the lexicon and using it changed the way I understand Statistics. Not every problem you deal with is clear set in stone quick mental thoughts. Reading and practicing allowed me to get a deeper understanding like the use of bayes theorem and conditional probability.",1,2,R is just another language for coding specifically designed for math. Its a very useful tool however I would not say I'd be able to manually create my own scripts simply because analyzing and doing something yourself is two different things so I cant say im an experienced R user,3,Again application is most important and the tutorials were very helpful but I am not a master and neither are any students otherwise we would all be teaching the course by now,4,Same answer as before,I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Agree,I feel like you can only agree with these statements if you can correlate examples in to your own personal life. Creating relatable questions always made me more intrigued in solving the problem.,Neither agree nor disagree,"The infographic was just like the other homework with more steps, run the code, analyze it and write the purpose and functions.","it was nice to collaborate with students from the course, we didnt have any issues but id say make more team based assignments. It gets you to verbally explain concepts outloud",I was not the biggest fan of lectures because the concepts were really rushed through  and it was hard to follow along and sometimes it was hard to understand the prof. I learned separately on my own time but attending lectures were never a waste of time. I learned the most through youtube and going bit by bit through the textbook
3,4,"At the beginning of the course, I only knew some basic meaning of statistics, such as mode, mean, etc. I only knew how to calculate the range and variance, and I couldn't communicate its meaning with others or analyze the deeper meaning. After the learning through these course, I know the meaning of data , and what can be analyzed from the calculated data. This is  helpful for my understanding of statistic knowledge and communication with others.",3,5,"At first, I knew nothing about R studio and other coding knowledge. In each class and homework teaching video, I gradually stopped being afraid of those code. Instead, I used the code to accurately find the data I need, and learned how the code generated graphs and tables.",3,"I focused on  the calculations before the term test, and my understanding of the concepts and meanings was not clear, so I did not perform well in the exam. After the exam, I paid more attention to understanding the meaning.",3,"I think the tutorial focuses more on teaching formula application, but the TA is very careful to help us and answer questions when we have questions.",I read the comments.,Agree,"The weekly assignments and tutorials used many interesting examples, which helped me better understand the application of statistics.",Agree,"In the group infographic assignment, I need to discuss statistic data with my members. For example, the first question we discussed was about the skewness of the histogram. In the process of communication, it made ours skills of communicating better and the understanding of the meaning of skewness deeper. ","I was responsible for integrating the graphs and text information provided by my members, as well as the color and layout of the infographics. I think the challenge is how to highlight the key points and make the infographics concise and clear. I referred to the examples provided by the teacher, selected the important information, and used bold color to highlight the key points.

I think the most important thing is to communicate with the members. If possible, I suggest choosing classmates who are familiar in the tutorial as members.","This course is interesting. I thought statistics was boring, but the lectures, homework, and tutorials provided lots of interesting examples to help me understand the meaning and knowledge of statistics."
2,4,"Before this course I never took anything similar like data management. After taking this course, I feel like I could take a look at a distribution of data and make some starting claims based on what I see. Further than this, I have a deeper understanding of probability now and how changes are calculated.",1,2,"I had no clue what R was at the beginning of the course. While I do know a few concepts on how to graph and work with data on R now, I wouldn't say I am proficient. We didn't really do any assignments requiring us to actually code, I think fitting a few simple assignments that force students to actually write their own R code would benefit.",4,"The weekly assignments actually helped a lot in understanding important concepts. To be completely honest, my professor would sometimes talk about things unrelated and beyond the scope of the course. The assignments helped me identify what is important.",5,My TA went over everything in detail giving us the intuition and tools to solve problems given during each tutorial. I feel like I left each tutorial understanding each concept more.,"I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,I feel like grounding the concepts we learned in real life really did help me understand why statistics is important.,Neither agree nor disagree,Ive made quite a few infographics in high school and this assignment was pretty much a repeat of that. I just had to draw my own conclusions from the data gathered from the assignment.,"I enjoyed working on the infographic itself after getting all the data since it was pretty light work. We just had to figure out a theme and decide on what and where to put everything. 

 

We didn't really encounter any challenges, I guess the only ""challenge we encountered"" was deciding what the main focus of our infographic would be. We resolved it using a vote.

 

Start early or you'll end up doing it last second.","Like in question 3, I had little to no knowledge of anything statistics related up till I took this course. I think this course gave me a good enough starting point in this subject. If only the lectures were a bit more focused on what was actually important, this course would have been a lot better."
2,4,"Before all I would be able to tell you is what the mean and maybe the median of a data set is. I would not know how to communicate things like standard deviation, variance or what these two measures even represent. Furthermore, while I w as aware of something called a bell shaped distribution, I was unaware of what equation it came from or more importantly how to calculate values from it. 

What this course has taught me to do is teaching me the fundamental of the statistical principles that are involved in it.",1,2,"Before this I had never even heard of R. But after going through the course I have seen that R has some strong tools, however I have personally never used them since all R assignments revolve around looking through the output of R code rather than understanding or writing any R code ourselves.",2,"I don't find that R assignments helped me with performing the calculations or being able to identify the key pieces of information in a problem statement. However, I have found that it was very cool to see R visualize the concepts we learn in class initially. 

In essence, I think the R assignments were fun and an interesting break from the standard work in university, but I don't think I got as much raw learning from them.",4,"I think that the tutorials were pretty useful in covering the concepts that we learned in class the week prior. However, I think that they could be improved because they always felt so short. It felt like the only thing we were ever able to do was to complete a worksheet that felt very short before time was up.",I took a quick look at the comments at the end.,Disagree,"We always found the statistical probability of seemingly random things. The ways we can arrange books on a bookshelf, the probability that someone from a group is using drugs. I personally have heard that statistics is a big part of data science but I have not not done any research on this and I am honestly unsure of what statistics can be used for in terms of getting a job in the real world.",Agree,While I have personally not completed the infographic assignment as of writing this survey I think that in general it is a useful tool to learn to better communicate statistical information because it involves communicating statistical information.,I enjoyed the overall brain storming process of the infographic and coming up with ideas of cool things we could do as a group. I don't think I've encountered any challenges outside of scheduling a group assignment amid the end of term assignment rush. I have no advice for future students because I think everyone knows the things they are supposed to do to succeed in a group assignment. Communicate communicate early and communicate.,"Overall I have learned more about the general tools of statistics and the theory involved in all the calculations when I see statistics out in the media. 

My overall learning experience has been good. I think the instructors did a good job teaching the material they were instructed to teach."
1,3,I have a grounded understand of Statisitcs knowledge and the vocabulary but I feel as if I could've learned a bit more but I had to focus my time elsewhere which would be other courses.,1,2,I have an alright idea of R. The only thing is that there were not tasks regarding R only understanding. I'm more of a hands on learner. I learn by doing and just understanding is not my strong suit.,4,The module were very nicely designed gave good amount of work to do and a lot of examples to get an understanding.,4,Tutorials were very well designed and I was able to understand with very minor erros on the tutorial worksheets.,"I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,Math is everywhere and so is stats. Statisitics is a very large portion of our lifes even thought we dont know it. ,Neither agree nor disagree,There is not much to effectively communicate. Other than just making an infographic and applying knowledge known there was not much to do than just doing a regular assignment.,I enjoyed designing the infographic and trying to figure out the format. That was the most challenging and where I had the most fun. I would give advice to have a plan for your days on what to do. Dont just go in and figure out as you go.,Very well. I am able to get a great understanding of Statistics. It was a bit hard during lecture hours to grasp the knowledge but the online vidoes helped me a lot.
4,3,"Back to hight school, I used to think statistics was an easy subject. However, after taking STA107, I learned many different ways to communicate statistics. Such as using the data tool R to generate various types of graphs.",2,4,"At the beginning of the course, I had no idea about R and I was really panicked about it since I am not the type of person who is good at coding. But after watching the professor's explanation video and completing a few homework assignments, I feel more confident with this software.",4,The weekly assignment is a great way to help me understand the concepts of each module.,4,"By doing the worksheets during tutorials, it enhanced my understanding of the module concepts.","I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,"Most likely all the weekly assignment are real-life scenarios, it feels like we are using what we learned to do some cool things, which made the subject much more engaging and valuable.",Strongly agree,Bringing everyone together and doing the same work and by group discussion and division of labor had improved my ability to communicate indeed.,"Our group is build by five peoples and most of them are my friends, so working collaboratively with friends is defiantly a really fun and memorable experience. One challenges I remember during on working on this assignment was the R code wasn't working and the output keep saying error, by discussing together and using the technology we resolved it. My advice for future students who will be working on this assignment would be start doing it early and also book the study room early.",This course significantly deepened my understanding of statistics by bridging theory with real-world applications. The hands-on assignments (like analyzing datasets in R) and clear explanations of concepts like hypothesis testing and regression made abstract ideas tangible. My overall experience was highly engaging—especially seeing how statistics drives decisions in fields like science.
4,4,"I gave myself a 4 because some of the knowledge i learned from high school and after taking in university, I understand the concepts more deeply and every week assignment help me a lot too. ",4,4,"I gave myself a 4 because I hadn’t used R before, but professor had really detail of teaching, so I learned it quickly. ",4,"I gave myself a 4 because the weekly assignments helped me understand the concepts better and every week professor posted a really detail video, she explained all of the code from the R. ",4,"I gave myself a 4 because the tutorials helped me understand the concepts more clearly, it will through assignment  it is include every week lecture information. ",I read the comments.,Strongly agree,"TA feedback is really helpful, especially before the test, it is a really good review sheet, and some of statistical examples are helpful in real life, because when I learn the knowledge I will use some real life example. ",Strongly agree,The infographic assignment helped me learn data from the music.

I enjoyed collaborating with classmates and combining our different strengths—some focused on stats, others on design or writing. It was rewarding to turn complex data into something clear and visually appealing.

One challenge we faced was coordinating schedules and agreeing on design choices. We overcame this by setting clear deadlines and using tools like Google Docs and Canva to stay organized and connected.

My advice to future students is to start early, communicate clearly, and divide tasks based on each person’s strengths. Teamwork becomes much easier when everyone is on the same page.","This course has helped me understand statistics not just as numbers, but as a way to make sense of real-world information. I learned how to analyze data, interpret graphs, and apply statistical concepts like probability and correlation in practical situations. The assignments, especially the infographic project, showed me how to communicate data clearly to others.

— The challenges I encountered were, first, I couldn't find the rest of my group members. Fortunately, Prof. Asal and the TA were always there to help, so I successfully found the rest of my group. The second challenge I encountered was that my group and I didn’t really know where to start, so we asked Prof. Asal during break time. She enthusiastically answered our questions and gave us a lot of advice.

— The advice I would give to future students is to watch the video demonstration about the infographic assignment before you start it, as it provides the overall information you may need when working on this assignment.

 ","The overall learning experience was fabulous. I learned so many things that could contribute to my future studies in statistics. Additionally, I feel that statistics can be applied to solving real-life questions, allowing me to develop better statistical thinking and the ability to analyze complex problems."

The biggest challenge is to find group members, because students usually do not talk in or after class, so it is difficult to find someone to get in a group. But luckily I have a group chat with my friends so I can find a group member easily.

Try to make some new friends and do not be shy, communicate with classmates in tutorials, that will be easier.","I want to choose statistics to be my major course, so it is one of the reasons that I am really interested in statistics.

The overall learning experience was nice, although the weekly assignments were a little annoying to do as some other courses I was taking also had weekly assignments due. "
2,4,After taking the course i feel i have more of a ability to understand stats and what they mean in context of a problem. ,1,3,Before the course i had zero knowledge of R and after i have learned a lot a about it.,2,I feel the weekly assignment helped a little because most of it was just done for you instead of having to do it yourself. ,3,The tutorial were helpful and the TA was able to explain somethings i was having trouble with.,"I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Agree,"The examples were really helpful to make me understand certain stuff, and was it is important.",Agree,"yes, after doing the infographic i feel i have improved my ability to communicate statistical information","the thing I enjoyed was being able to work with other students, some challenges were the disputes about the design choices of the infographic which we resolved and discusses and debating which choices we should use, one piece of advice for future students would be have a plan before starting.","This course contributed a lot to my understanding, I know more about how probability works and its real world consequences. My overall learning experience was good because well prepared slides and each weeks content was clearly organized and easy to go though. "
1,4,I am somewhat confident in my manipulation of statistical information however I feel somewhat lacking regarding the interpretation and forming of conclusions.,1,3,I am still not used to the syntax of R however reading it is relatively easy and intuitive.,4,I believe I formed a good starting foundation in my understanding of statistical concepts despite having no previous experience in the topic.,4,The tutorial worksheets were very thorough in showing exactly what I needed to know every week.,I read the comments.,Agree,Most examples we would cover in lecture slides were consistent and clear in their purpose but sometimes I would need to do my own research after the fact to understand more expansive applications of the concepts.,Neither agree nor disagree,I felt the infographic assignment was very limited compared to previous examples shown in terms of the broadness of the topic.,"The visual presentation aspect of the assignment was probably the most enjoyable step as I could better communicate our findings. 

Group member communication was a large issue at the beginning however it was resolved with a few meetings. Division of work was also somewhat of an issue as a few group members contributed significantly less, although part of the reason is due to some group members wanting to do more.

Definitely communicatee with other students more in tutorials and form a group to work on the infographic assignment prior to its release.

 ","The overall learning experience was tremendously smooth and structured compared to other courses I have taken at UTM. There were many opportunities to apply course concepts weekly through assignments, worksheets, tutorials, and readings. Additionally having every lecture available as a recording was very helpful. I would say I am on course and looking forward to future STA classes at UTM."

Advice for Future Students
Communicate early and clarify roles.

Use team strengths: some people are good at design, some are good at analysis.

Keep it simple: make sure your infographic is easy to understand.","This course gave me a better understanding of statistics by making complex concepts easier to understand and showing how they apply to real-world situations. I feel more confident both analyzing data and communicating results clearly.

Overall, this course was a great combination of hands-on and support. The assignments and group work helped me apply what I learned, and the tutorials did a great job of clearing up any confusion. It was challenging, but very rewarding."

2,2,"I'm still unsure about how statistics really work, I do understand the basic concept, but other than that, I don't think I am able to explain it further. ",1,3,"My ability to use R statistical software in the course was nonexistent since I had never heard of it before. I would say that my ability to use it is a 3 since I now know how to navigate it while also adding on to my knowledge of using Python, kind of. I'm not sure if those are even similar, but they are both coding and remind me of each other. ",3,"I think I do understand the concepts more after doing the weekly assignment for it. I do enjoy doing the assignments as they make me understand them to be able to do them effectively. I don't think that my understanding fully improves just from doing the weekly assignment, though. ",2,"I feel like after participating in the weekly tutorials, I don't improve in any way because my tutorial is after I finish the weekly assignment, so all of the content I have already been through, and I'm just answering questions that I've already seen. ",I didn't read the comments.,Agree,"I do see how there is relevance to doing statistics since it is used in our daily lives, and everything we do can be connected to probability. ",Neither agree nor disagree,I'm not sure if the infographic assignment helped me improve anything. I honestly feel like it just caused me to have more of an ability to want to communicate because of group members not communicating. ,"I did not like working on the infographic because of the communication of the group members. It was kind of lacking and hard to communicate properly and get the job done effectively. I would give the advice that future students should make friends in the course so that it will be easier to do the assignment with, rather than trying to collect group members to do the assignment. ","My overall learning experience for statistics could've been better, I feel like I was having trouble catching up with the course materials. It would've been better if the lectures were more engaging and I would actually want to attend them. "

It is not guaranteed the random people you are assigned to has the same goals as you. ","This course contributed well to my basic understanding of statistic fundamentals. The overall learning experience of this course was fair, the tutorials made it a lot easier on me."
1,4,"Before taking this course, I had failed a 200-level statistics class. I realized that my failure was mainly due to having no foundational knowledge in statistics. That’s why I rated myself a 1 in terms of my ability to communicate statistics at the beginning of this course. I chose to take STA107 because I wanted to build a solid foundation in statistics. After completing the course, I feel that my overall performance was quite good. I’ve gained a better understanding of statistical concepts and improved my ability to communicate statistical information, so I gave myself a score of 4.",1,3,"n the statistics course I previously failed, I was also introduced to R, which felt like a completely new “language” to me. In STA107, I worked very hard to learn how to use R. Although the overall learning process went relatively smoothly, I still have some confusion and areas where I need improvement. I hope that in future statistics courses, I can further enhance my skills in using R and learn more practical techniques and methods.",4,"I think the assignments were a great way to help me engage more deeply with the weekly topics. Before doing the assignments, I often had a lot of confusion, but during the process of completing them, many of my questions were resolved.",5,"I really enjoyed the weekly tutorials (and I really liked this semester’s TA as well)! During the tutorials, the practice problems provided by the TA helped make the weekly concepts more concrete. By working through these exercises, we were able to better understand the material and also prepare more effectively for exams.","I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Strongly agree,"For the Q11: When I work on tutorial exercises, I usually have a rough estimate of what my score should be. If my actual score is lower than expected, I always take a close look at my incorrect answers and make sure to find and study the correct solutions carefully.

For the Q12: I’ve always found statistics to be a fascinating subject, which is why I chose it as my major. Previously, my understanding of statistics was quite basic—I knew it played a role in many areas of everyday life, but I didn’t fully grasp how it actually connected to the real world. This course completely reshaped my view of the discipline. After completing it, I’ve come to realize just how deeply statistics is embedded in our daily lives in practical and meaningful ways.",Strongly agree,"I think this was one of the most interesting projects I’ve ever done! I used to think that statistics was mainly about plain and sometimes “boring” numbers and charts. But while working on the infographic with my group, I realized that data and graphs can actually be presented in much more vivid and engaging ways.","The part I enjoyed the most in this assignment was the process of discussing and solving problems with my group members. Every time we figured out a question together, it gave us a strong sense of accomplishment and also helped build great teamwork and mutual understanding within the group.

The main challenge we faced was coordinating everyone’s schedules. Since it was close to final exams, all of us were overwhelmed with coursework. Our group had four members, and it was really hard to find a time when everyone was available, which led to some wasted time in the beginning. However, our solution was quite simple: each of us worked efficiently during the limited time we had, and luckily, every group member was very cooperative and responsible. Although we haven’t officially submitted the assignment yet, we’ve already completed almost all of the content.

For future students who will be working on this assignment, my advice is to coordinate your schedules and start working as soon as the assignment is released and group members are confirmed. Also, it's really helpful if each member shares their strengths at the beginning. That way, you can divide the work based on individual strengths, which makes the collaboration much more efficient and productive.","I think this course has given me a solid foundation in statistics. My previous failure in a statistics course once made me feel very frustrated, and I even started to question whether I was truly suited for this major. However, after completing STA107, my confidence has improved significantly. I was able to identify the areas where I was lacking, and this course helped me fill in those gaps. Now, I feel much more prepared to face more advanced and challenging statistical topics in the future."
3,4,"Before the course, I knew about the basic types of graphs and statistical terminologies, such as mean, median, IQR, etc.

Furthermore, the real-world examples motivate me to learn more, since I recognize the importance of statistics in everyday life.",Strongly agree,"The infographic assignment was extremely fun and I believe that it improved my ability to communicate in two ways. Firstly, since we were working in a group, my verbal communication and teamwork skills were enhanced. Secondly, through the process of designing the infographic, my data communication skills were enhanced.","I enjoyed working on the assignment overall since it promoted teamwork and a fun, motivated learning experience. The main challenges we encountered were communication issues and differences in ideas for the infographic. We ultimately resolved these issues through clear communication and group voting. I'd give future students one singular advice: communicate clearly, and have fun.","The course contributed heavily to my understanding of statistical concepts, especially their application in real life. For me, the overall learning experience was extremely fun and informative. The course structure made learning fun, and I believe when learning is made fun, students learn the most, which is exactly what happened to me."

However, the topic could have been better since music and mental health aren't things that the majority of people relate to. Instead, for future sessions, perhaps choosing a topic within domains that are relatable to everyone would be more interesting (e.g, Healthcare).","I enjoyed working with other students, whom I frankly had never spoken to before. Not only did my infographic communication skills improve but also my communication with my peers. Despite having disagreements on certain parts of the infographic and display, we worked through it and came to common ground which enhanced our teamwork skills. Advice I would give future students would be not to be scared to talk to new people and to ensure that you have delegated and split tasks at an early stage of the assignment so that there is no confusion and everything is organised.","My overall learning experience in this course has been positive since I took the course starting with a CS major. However, after taking this course, I fell in love with stats and decided to pursue this major instead.

4,4,Is my first time doing statistics and firstly it was so complicated for me because i not really good at math and the our sta professor really good at expressing the things we did in class like i am clear for the things that the professor talk about and the tutorial really helps too make me. more clear about what we did in lec and the home works,4,4,i am able to learn R at first i thought it was very complicated but then i felt like is not that diffcult of learning R becasue the professor told us what to put already all we have to do just read the displays.,4,this help alot the module weekly assignemnt is very useful of understanding R and use data in Coding which is also very cool to learn.,4,this is also very helpful the TA's explain everything to make sure we understand what we did for the weekly assignment. and there is always a survey to make sure us understand it.,"I looked at the mark, then if it's lower than expected I look through the comments.",Strongly agree,the weekly assignemtn are always tie up with real life case which help me undersatand how statistic in real life work.,Agree,yes when gethering the datas i am also doing my own reaserch which i also explore the things that i have never see before.,i enjoy workiing on the R module weekly assingment it really cool and helps organized data perfectly. the challenges i enocunter first was those venn diagram symbols at first it was pretty hard for me to regonzied which one is which and if you cant regognized it is hard for you to do the rest course work so i spend some time on it firgure out which one is which and finally got thorugh it now. the advise ill give to the future studnet is always go on lec and always go to tut it helps alot for understaning for the assignment.,it helps alot at first we reading the displays what it means on the displays and also we the tut TA explain everyhting cleraly for you my worry at the beginning is gone after pursuing the class becaseu i was not good at math and i intreset to numbers overall i like this course alot everything in the course.
2,4,"Through this course, I have learned a great deal about the language of statistics and how to use statistical methods to calculate the probability of events and make informed, logical analyses. Compared to before I took this course, my ability to interpret and communicate statistical information has improved significantly. I’ve gained a better understanding of how to present data clearly and support arguments with evidence derived from statistical reasoning.

However, I also recognize that there is still much more for me to learn. Statistics is a field that requires constant practice and application, and I am committed to continuing to develop my skills. I look forward to deepening my understanding and becoming more confident in using statistics to analyze real-world problems.",1,3,"Before taking this course, I had no knowledge of R at all. I was completely unfamiliar with how it worked or how to interpret its outputs. However, after completing the course, I’ve learned how to read and understand R output, including statistical summaries, data tables, and visualizations. I can now make sense of the information R provides and use it to support basic data analysis.

That said, I still find the coding aspect of R challenging. Writing and modifying code is something I’m not yet confident in, and I often struggle with the syntax and logic behind certain commands. I realize that this is an important part of working with R, so I know I still have a lot to learn. Moving forward, I plan to spend more time practicing coding and exploring how to apply R to more complex problems. With continued effort, I hope to become more comfortable using R as a powerful tool for statistical analysis.",5,"The assignments each week were closely related to the topics we had just learned, which really helped reinforce the material. By applying the concepts to real-world examples, I was able to develop a deeper understanding of the key ideas. Analyzing practical scenarios not only made the content more engaging, but also allowed me to see how statistical methods can be used to interpret and solve problems in everyday situations.",5,"The tutorial worksheets were closely connected to the assignments and helped reinforce the fundamental concepts we were learning. They provided valuable opportunities to review and apply key ideas, making it easier to understand how everything fit together. The TA also played a crucial role in the learning process—each week, they would go over the main topics and assignment questions, helping to clarify any confusion. This review not only strengthened my grasp of the material but also gave me greater confidence in applying what I had learned.",I always made sure to read all the comments and to talk to the TA if anything isn't clear.,Strongly agree,The statistical examples presented in the course were practical and clearly showed how statistics can be applied in real-life situations. They helped me understand how data can be used to make informed decisions and why statistical thinking is valuable across different fields. These examples made the learning process more engaging and meaningful.,Strongly agree,"I’m someone who tends to understand information better through visuals rather than text. Throughout the course, the use of charts, graphs, and other visual representations in both the lectures and assignments helped me grasp the distribution of data and key statistical concepts more clearly. These visuals made complex ideas more accessible and allowed me to see patterns and relationships in the data that would have been harder to interpret through numbers or written explanations alone. This visual approach significantly enhanced my learning experience and deepened my appreciation for how statistics can be applied to real-world problems.","This was a very enjoyable group project. I really liked working with my classmates to discuss the main points of the assignment and carefully go over the requirements together. We made an effort to present all the elements clearly and thoroughly in our final work. I also found it fun and creative to brainstorm ideas as a group, especially when it came to layout and design. Collaborating on how to organize and decorate our project made the experience even more engaging.

We faced only a very minor challenge: as non-native English speakers, we initially misunderstood part of the assignment instructions. However, we reached out to the professor in time and were able to resolve the issue quickly.

For future students, I would recommend working with people you know and feel comfortable with. Don’t be afraid to share your ideas actively—group work is a great chance to learn from each other and make something meaningful together.","The content of this course was very well-structured, with a strong sense of continuity between each lesson. Every topic built naturally on the previous one, which made it easier to follow and understand the overall progression of the material. Both the professor and the TA were extremely responsible and supportive—they were always willing to answer my questions and took the time to explain things patiently and clearly.

Thanks to their guidance, I was able to develop a much deeper understanding of the course content. Occasionally, the professor would also introduce concepts from future topics, which gave me a helpful foundation and made me feel more prepared for what’s ahead in my studies."
2,3,"I have learned some beneficial information, but there is a lot more to learn ",1,3,"I did not know anything about R before this course, and I learned the basics over the course. the homework assignments and the videos for the homework assignments explaining the code were specifically useful.",4,"The homework assignments helped me understand the weekly modules, as I had to explain the concepts for each week at the end of the assignments. They also helped me stay on track with the course because I probably would not have studied weekly. ",4,"Same as homework assignments, the tutorial worksheets reinforced the ideas from the weekly modules",I read the comments.,Agree,The statistical examples were relevant real-world examples most of the time that showcased the usefulness of statistics,Disagree,"I think the assignment was okay. It probably would have been easier in partners, groups of two, as dividing the work between five people was more work than actually doing the assignment.","The most difficult part was dividing the work between group members, but I enjoyed creating graphs and a Canva post with my group members. One advice I would give would be to keep your group members updated on the work and don't be afraid to voice your opinions.","I knew very little about statistics before the course, and I am glad I took the course to become familiar with important and foundational concepts of statistics before taking more math or computer-heavy statistics courses. My overall experience with the course was positive, and Prof. Asal is an enthusiastic and helpful professor. "
3,4,"Before I take this course, I have only some experience on communicating statistics.

The TA will guide students go through the worksheets.",I read the comments.,Strongly agree,"Real-life examples make abstract statistical ideas easier to understand. They show how statistics can be applied in fields like medicine, business, psychology, or politics. Seeing actual data used to answer real questions makes the subject feel more meaningful.",Strongly disagree,The infographic assignment improved my ability to search for example of infographics and my ability to conclude informations and interpret statistical information throught inforgraphics.,"I enjoy that this assignment allowed me to work with other people and exchange ideas.

When I working on the assignment, the biggest chanllenge I faced is the infographic design because I have never designed such thing before, but luckly nowadays, it is very easy for a beginner to create thier own grapgh by tools like canvas.

For the future students, I want to say that collaboration is the key to overcome any challengr in statistic courses.","This course has significantly improved my understanding of statistics by breaking down complex concepts into clear, practical examples. I’ve learned not only how to perform statistical calculations, but also how to interpret data, recognize patterns, and make informed decisions based on evidence.

It was fun to see how different people thought about the data and what kind of visuals we could use. We all had different strengths, and it helped us make a better final product.

 

One challenge was finding time to meet and work together because we all had different schedules. We fixed this by using a shared document and chatting online to plan things out. We also had different opinions on how to show the data, but we talked it through and picked the clearest option.

 

My advice for future students is to start early and talk with your group often. Make sure everyone knows what they’re doing and try to work together, not just split the work. Be open to ideas—working as a team can help you learn more.","This course helped me understand how statistics is used to make sense of data and answer real questions.

I worked with two other students, and we all clicked right away when it came to working together. We had an in-person meeting to go through the R activity, then a long Zoom call where we worked on the infographic, talking through every detail. Even though we didn’t know each other before, we got along really well, checked in with each other’s ideas, and split the work evenly. Honestly, we didn’t run into any challenges - it was a smooth process from start to finish, and I'm really grateful. Everyone was involved and on the same page, which made the whole experience really enjoyable. For future students, I’d say communication is key. Set up meetings early, make sure everyone’s ideas are heard, and just be open to working as a team. When everyone’s engaged, the assignment becomes way more fun and way less stressful!","This course reinforced a lot of what I had already learned in high school, but it also gave me a deeper understanding of how statistics is applied in real-world scenarios. I was already comfortable with the basic concepts, so many of the ideas made sense pretty quickly. What I really appreciated was the chance to work with data more hands-on, especially using software to analyze results. Overall, my learning experience was smooth and engaging. Even though coding in R wasn’t the main focus, I got familiar with the tools used in statistical analysis. The course helped solidify my understanding and showed me how statistics is actually used beyond just theory."

I think this assignment is great way to meet and become friends with other people. I enjoyed talking about the assignment and random things in general with my groupmates. It was refreshing to talk to new people especially since most of the courses I'm taking makes me feel isolated from my classmates! I also liked how my groupmates and I had different ideas and how we wanted to incorporate our own distinctive styles in our infographic.

My group did not face much challenges, which was great! The only obstacle we faced was deciding what and what not to add on the infographic, and ensuring we meet the deadlines we set for ourselves.

My advice to future students who will be working on a collaborative assignment in a statistics course is to communicate! it's important to start early especially in a group setting to avoid future challenges. Being communicative is a great help to ensure that things works well in the assignment and between the groupmates!","Although I took a statistics course in grade 12, this course allowed me to further explore topics and concepts that were barely touched upon on in high school. Some course concepts also helped me discover specific parts of statistics that I'm interested (I really enjoyed solving real life problems and doing the R assignments) and disinterested (I'm not really fond of permutations and combinations since high school, and this course reignite the disinterest I still have lol) in!

I really enjoyed this course because of the diverse ways of the course delivery. I'm so used to taking lecture notes and doing written assignments. It was a nice change to do various tasks in this course such as the R assignments and the infographic assignment! However, I do think that what slowed down my progress in completing a week's material is the amount of lecture slides. I feel like there was a lot of slides that are not as important. Although I like doing math proofs, I feel like it is not useful for me when I'm doing homework problems.

 

Overall, I really enjoyed STA107! This course helped me realize how much I like stats, giving me reassurance that I do want to major in stats. My prof and TA were really helpful in answering my questions and giving me insights for future courses."

No challenges to speak of. Advice: work with people you know.,"Look, I think you have a decent course, but to be perfectly candid, I found it wholly boring. Aside from R, I don't think I learned a single new thing from AP Statistics. In fact, AP Stats had MORE rigor, since we were expected to write a great deal. Further, we learned a fair bit more in AP Stats, which is really surprising.  I don't think it's your fault to be sure, and I don't have any major complaints about the class, but seriously the registrar not counting AP Stats as 107 equivalent is utter nonsense. Please, raise this, (although, the stats curriculum changed recently in ways I'm not aware of right now). Anyway, complaint over, I think the class was pretty good. Lectures felt naturally flowing for the bulk of the content, and were relatively easy to follow. I think you should rework the assignments and have them be more like the tutorials, and have the assignments be more touched on in tutorials. Thanks for reading and teaching!"
