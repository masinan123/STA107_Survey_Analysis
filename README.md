# STA107 Post-Course Survey Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete analysis for the paper *STA107 Post-Course Survey Analysis: Evaluating Student Reflections on R and Statistical Learning*. This study investigates how students in **STA107: Introduction to Statistics** at the University of Toronto Mississauga perceived their learning experiences with R programming, statistical concepts, communication skills, and course delivery.

The survey used a mixed-methods design, incorporating both quantitative Likert-scale ratings and qualitative open-ended responses. Our analysis integrates statistical tests, thematic coding, and sentiment analysis to evaluate the impact of course components such as tutorials, TA support, and real-world examples.

## File Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `data/`  
  Contains the cleaned survey dataset and raw input files used for analysis.

- `scripts/`  
  Includes all R scripts used for data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and qualitative coding.

- `paper/`  
  Contains the final research report in both Quarto and PDF formats.

## Key Findings

- **Improved Communication Skills**: Significant gain in students' ability to articulate statistical ideas (paired t-test, *p* < 0.001).
- **Growth in R Proficiency**: Clear improvement in R usage confidence post-course (*p* < 0.001).
- **Tutorials vs. Assignments**: Tutorials slightly outperformed assignments in enhancing conceptual understanding.
- **Valued Course Elements**: Students praised TA support, tutorial structure, and real-world examples.
